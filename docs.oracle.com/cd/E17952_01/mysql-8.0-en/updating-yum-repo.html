      For supported Yum-based platforms (see
      <a class="xref" href="linux-installation-yum-repo.html" title="2.5.1 Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL Yum Repository">Section 2.5.1, “Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL Yum Repository”</a>, for a list), you
      can perform an in-place upgrade for MySQL (that is, replacing the
      old version and then running the new version using the old data
      files) with the MySQL Yum repository.

            Before performing any update to MySQL, follow carefully the
            instructions in <a class="xref" href="upgrading.html" title="2.10 Upgrading MySQL">Section 2.10, “Upgrading MySQL”</a>. Among other
            instructions discussed there, it is especially important to
            back up your database before the update.

            The following instructions assume you have installed MySQL
            with the MySQL Yum repository or with an RPM package
            directly downloaded from
            <a class="ulink" href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/" target="_top">MySQL Developer Zone's

            following the instructions in

          By default, the MySQL Yum repository updates MySQL to the
          latest version in the release series you have chosen during
          installation (see <a class="xref" href="linux-installation-yum-repo.html#yum-repo-select-series" title="Selecting a Release Series">Selecting a Release Series</a> for
          details), which means, for example, a 5.7.x
          installation is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> updated to a
          8.0.x release automatically. To update to another
          release series, you must first disable the subrepository for
          the series that has been selected (by default, or by yourself)
          and enable the subrepository for your target series. To do
          that, see the general instructions given in
          <a class="xref" href="linux-installation-yum-repo.html#yum-repo-select-series" title="Selecting a Release Series">Selecting a Release Series</a>. For upgrading from
          MySQL 5.7 to 8.0, perform the
          <span class="emphasis"><em>reverse</em></span> of the steps illustrated in
          <a class="xref" href="linux-installation-yum-repo.html#yum-repo-select-series" title="Selecting a Release Series">Selecting a Release Series</a>, disabling the
          subrepository for the MySQL 5.7 series and
          enabling that for the MySQL 8.0 series.
        </p><p>
          As a general rule, to upgrade from one release series to
          another, go to the next series rather than skipping a series.
          For example, if you are currently running MySQL 5.6 and wish
          to upgrade to 8.0, upgrade to MySQL
          5.7 first before upgrading to 8.0.

            For important information about upgrading from MySQL
            5.7 to 8.0, see

          </p></div></li><li class="listitem"><h4><a id="idm45829051077232"></a>Upgrading MySQL</h4><p>
          Upgrade MySQL and its components by the following command, for
          platforms that are not dnf-enabled:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">sudo yum update mysql-server
</pre><p>
          For platforms that are dnf-enabled:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">sudo dnf upgrade mysql-server
</pre><p>
          Alternatively, you can update MySQL by telling Yum to update
          everything on your system, which might take considerably more
          time. For platforms that are not dnf-enabled:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">sudo yum update
</pre><p>
          For platforms that are dnf-enabled:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">sudo dnf upgrade
</pre></li><li class="listitem"><h4><a id="idm45829051070304"></a>Restarting MySQL</h4><p>
          The MySQL server always restarts after an update by Yum. Prior
          to MySQL 8.0.16, run <a class="link" href="mysql-upgrade.html" title="4.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"><span class="command"><strong>mysql_upgrade</strong></span></a> after
          the server restarts to check and possibly resolve any
          incompatibilities between the old data and the upgraded
          software. <a class="link" href="mysql-upgrade.html" title="4.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"><span class="command"><strong>mysql_upgrade</strong></span></a> also performs other
          functions; for details, see <a class="xref" href="mysql-upgrade.html" title="4.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables">Section 4.4.5, “mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables”</a>.
          As of MySQL 8.0.16, this step is not required, as the server
          performs all tasks previously handled by
          <a class="link" href="mysql-upgrade.html" title="4.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"><span class="command"><strong>mysql_upgrade</strong></span></a>.
        </p></li></ol></div><p>
      You can also update only a specific component. Use the following
      command to list all the installed packages for the MySQL
      components (for dnf-enabled systems, replace
      <span class="command"><strong>yum</strong></span> in the command with
      <span class="command"><strong>dnf</strong></span>):
    </p><pre class="programlisting">sudo yum list installed | grep "^mysql"
</pre><p>
      After identifying the package name of the component of your
      choice, update the package with the following command, replacing
      <em class="replaceable"><code>package-name</code></em> with the name of the
      package. For platforms that are not dnf-enabled:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">sudo yum update <em class="replaceable"><code>package-name</code></em>
  </pre><p>
      For dnf-enabled platforms:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">sudo dnf upgrade <em class="replaceable"><code>package-name</code></em>
  </pre><h4><a id="updating-yum-repo-client-lib"></a>Upgrading the Shared Client Libraries</h4><p>
      After updating MySQL using the Yum repository, applications
      compiled with older versions of the shared client libraries should
      continue to work.
    </p><p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>If you recompile applications and dynamically link them
      with the updated libraries: </em></span> As typical with new
      versions of shared libraries where there are differences or
      additions in symbol versioning between the newer and older
      libraries (for example, between the newer, standard
      8.0 shared client libraries and some
      older—prior or variant—versions of the shared
      libraries shipped natively by the Linux distributions' software
      repositories, or from some other sources), any applications
      compiled using the updated, newer shared libraries require those
      updated libraries on systems where the applications are deployed.
      As expected, if those libraries are not in place, the applications
      requiring the shared libraries fail. For this reason, be sure to
      deploy the packages for the shared libraries from MySQL on those
      systems. To do this, add the MySQL Yum repository to the systems
      (see <a class="xref" href="linux-installation-yum-repo.html#yum-repo-setup" title="Adding the MySQL Yum Repository">Adding the MySQL Yum Repository</a>) and install the latest
      shared libraries using the instructions given in
      <a class="xref" href="linux-installation-yum-repo.html#yum-install-components" title="Installing Additional MySQL Products and Components with Yum">Installing Additional MySQL Products and Components with Yum</a>.
