        When a joining member connects to an online existing member for
        state transfer during distributed recovery, the joining member
        acts as a client on the connection and the existing member acts
        as a server. When state transfer from the donor's binary log is
        in progress over this connection (using the asynchronous
        replication channel
        <code class="literal">group_replication_recovery</code>), the joining
        member acts as the replica and the existing member acts as the
        source. When a remote cloning operation is in progress over this
        connection, the joining member acts as a recipient and the
        existing member acts as a donor. Configuration settings that
        apply to those roles outside the Group Replication context can
        apply for Group Replication also, unless they are overridden by
        a Group Replication-specific configuration setting or behavior.
      </p><p>
        The connection that an existing member offers to a joining
        member for distributed recovery is not the same connection that
        is used by Group Replication for communication between online
        members of the group.

            For distributed recovery, up to MySQL 8.0.20, group members
            offer their standard SQL client connection to joining

            <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_hostname"><code class="literal">hostname</code></a> and

            From MySQL 8.0.21, group members may advertise an
            alternative list of distributed recovery endpoints as
            dedicated client connections for joining members, allowing
            you to control distributed recovery traffic separately from

            system variable, and the member transmits their list of
            distributed recovery endpoints to the group when they join
            the group. The default is that the member continues to offer
            the standard SQL client connection as in earlier releases.

          Distributed recovery can fail if a joining member cannot
          correctly identify the other members using the host name as
          defined by MySQL Server's
          <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_hostname"><code class="literal">hostname</code></a> system variable. It
          is recommended that operating systems running MySQL have a
          properly configured unique host name, either using DNS or
          local settings. The host name that the server is using for SQL
          client connections can be verified in the
          <code class="literal">Member_host</code> column of the Performance
          Schema table
          <a class="link" href="performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.html" title="27.12.11.11 The replication_group_members Table"><code class="literal">replication_group_members</code></a>. If
          multiple group members externalize a default host name set by
          the operating system, there is a chance of the joining member
          not resolving it to the correct member address and not being
          able to connect for distributed recovery. In this situation
          you can use MySQL Server's
          <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_report_host"><code class="literal">report_host</code></a> system variable
          to configure a unique host name to be externalized by each of
          the servers.
        </p></div><p>
        The steps for a joining member to establish a connection for
        distributed recovery are as follows:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
            When the member joins the group, it connects with one of the

            <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_group_seeds"><code class="literal">group_replication_group_seeds</code></a>
            system variable, initially using the

            connection as specified in that list. The seed members might
            be a subset of the group.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Over this connection, the seed member uses Group
            Replication's membership service to provide the joining
            member with a list of all the members that are online in the
            group, in the form of a view. The membership information
            includes the details of the distributed recovery endpoints
            or standard SQL client connection offered by each member for
            distributed recovery.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The joining member selects a suitable group member from this
            list to be its donor for distributed recovery, following the
            behaviors described in
            <a class="xref" href="group-replication-distributed-recovery-fault.html" title="18.5.4.4 Fault Tolerance for Distributed Recovery">Section 18.5.4.4, “Fault Tolerance for Distributed Recovery”</a>.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The joining member then attempts to connect to the donor
            using the donor's advertised distributed recovery endpoints,
            trying each in turn in the order they are specified in the
            list. If the donor provides no endpoints, the joining member
            attempts to connect using the donor's standard SQL client
            connection. The SSL requirements for the connection are as
            specified by the
            <code class="literal">group_replication_recovery_ssl_*</code> options
            described in

          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If the joining member is not able to connect to the selected
            donor, it retries with other suitable donors, following the

            <a class="xref" href="group-replication-distributed-recovery-fault.html" title="18.5.4.4 Fault Tolerance for Distributed Recovery">Section 18.5.4.4, “Fault Tolerance for Distributed Recovery”</a>.
            Note that if the joining member exhausts the list of
            advertised endpoints without making a connection, it does
            not fall back to the donor's standard SQL client connection,
            but switches to another donor.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            When the joining member establishes a distributed recovery
            connection with a donor, it uses that connection for state
            transfer as described in
            <a class="xref" href="group-replication-distributed-recovery.html" title="18.5.4 Distributed Recovery">Section 18.5.4, “Distributed Recovery”</a>.
            The host and port for the connection that is used are shown
            in the joining member's log. Note that if a remote cloning
            operation is used, when the joining member has restarted at
            the end of the operation, it establishes a connection with a
            new donor for state transfer from the binary log. This might
            be a connection to a different member from the original
            donor used for the remote cloning operation, or it might be
            a different connection to the original donor. In any case,
            the distributed recovery process continues in the same way
            as it would have with the original donor.

          The server must listen for TCP/IP connections on these ports.

          not offered as a fallback if the donor's list of endpoints is
          exhausted without a connection. If you want to offer the

          From MySQL 8.0.18, you can optionally configure compression
          for distributed recovery by the method of state transfer from
          a donor's binary log. Compression can benefit distributed
          recovery where network bandwidth is limited and the donor has
          to transfer many transactions to the joining member. The

          Distributed recovery requires a replication user that has the
          correct permissions so that Group Replication can establish
          direct member-to-member replication channels. The replication
          user must also have the correct permissions to act as the
          clone user on the donor for a remote cloning operation. The
          same replication user must be used for distributed recovery on
          every group member. For instructions to set up this

          SSL for distributed recovery is configured separately from SSL
          for normal group communications, which is determined by the
          server's SSL settings and the
          <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_ssl_mode"><code class="literal">group_replication_ssl_mode</code></a>
          system variable. For distributed recovery connections,
          dedicated Group Replication distributed recovery SSL system
          variables are available to configure the use of certificates
          and ciphers specifically for distributed recovery.
        </p><p>
          By default, SSL is not used for distributed recovery
          connections. To activate it, set

          You need a replication user that is set up to use SSL.
        </p><p>
          When distributed recovery is configured to use SSL, Group
          Replication applies this setting for remote cloning
          operations, as well as for state transfer from a donor's
          binary log. Group Replication automatically configures the

          is set to <code class="literal">OFF</code>), and the replication user
          account for Group Replication authenticates with the
          <code class="literal">caching_sha2_password</code> plugin (which is the
          default in MySQL 8.0) or the
          <code class="literal">sha256_password</code> plugin, RSA key-pairs are
          used for password exchange. In this case, either use the
          <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_public_key_path"><code class="literal">group_replication_recovery_public_key_path</code></a>
          system variable to specify the RSA public key file, or use the

          system variable to request the public key from the source, as
