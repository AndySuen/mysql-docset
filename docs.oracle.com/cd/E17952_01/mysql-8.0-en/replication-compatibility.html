      MySQL supports replication from one release series to the next
      higher release series. For example, you can replicate from a
      source running MySQL 5.6 to a replica running MySQL 5.7, from a
      source running MySQL 5.7 to a replica running MySQL 8.0, and so
      on. However, you might encounter difficulties when replicating
      from an older source to a newer replica if the source uses
      statements or relies on behavior no longer supported in the
      version of MySQL used on the replica. For example, foreign key
      names longer than 64 characters are no longer supported from MySQL
      8.0.
    </p><p>
      The use of more than two MySQL Server versions is not supported in
      replication setups involving multiple sources, regardless of the
      number of source or replica MySQL servers. This restriction
      applies not only to release series, but to version numbers within
      the same release series as well. For example, if you are using a
      chained or circular replication setup, you cannot use MySQL
      8.0.22, MySQL 8.0.24, and MySQL
      8.0.28 concurrently, although you could use any two
      of these releases together.
    </p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><div class="admon-title">Important</div><p>
        It is strongly recommended to use the most recent release
        available within a given MySQL release series because
        replication (and other) capabilities are continually being
        improved. It is also recommended to upgrade sources and replicas
        that use early releases of a release series of MySQL to GA
        (production) releases when the latter become available for that
        release series.
      </p></div><p>
      From MySQL 8.0.14, the server version is recorded in the binary
      log for each transaction for the server that originally committed
      the transaction
      (<a class="link" href="replication-options-source.html#sysvar_original_server_version"><code class="literal">original_server_version</code></a>), and
      for the server that is the immediate source of the current server
      in the replication topology
      (<a class="link" href="replication-options-source.html#sysvar_immediate_server_version"><code class="literal">immediate_server_version</code></a>).
    </p><p>
      Replication from newer sources to older replicas might be
      possible, but is generally not supported. This is due to a number
      of factors:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><strong>Binary log format changes. </strong>
            The binary log format can change between major releases.
            While we attempt to maintain backward compatibility, this is
            not always possible. A source might also have optional
            features enabled that are not understood by older replicas,
            such as binary log transaction compression, where the
            resulting compressed transaction payloads cannot be read by
            a replica at a release before MySQL 8.0.20.
          </p><p>
          This also has significant implications for upgrading
          replication servers; see
          <a class="xref" href="replication-upgrade.html" title="17.5.3 Upgrading a Replication Topology">Section 17.5.3, “Upgrading a Replication Topology”</a>, for more information.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          For more information about row-based replication, see
          <a class="xref" href="replication-formats.html" title="17.2.1 Replication Formats">Section 17.2.1, “Replication Formats”</a>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><strong>SQL incompatibilities. </strong>
            You cannot replicate from a newer source to an older replica
            using statement-based replication if the statements to be
            replicated use SQL features available on the source but not
            on the replica.
          </p><p>
          However, if both the source and the replica support row-based
          replication, and there are no data definition statements to be
          replicated that depend on SQL features found on the source but
          not on the replica, you can use row-based replication to
          replicate the effects of data modification statements even if
          the DDL run on the source is not supported on the replica.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      In MySQL 8.0.26, incompatible changes were made to replication
      instrumentation names, including the names of thread stages,
      containing the terms <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">master</span>”</span>, which is changed to
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">source</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">slave</span>”</span>, which is changed to
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">replica</span>”</span>, and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mts</span>”</span> (for
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">multithreaded slave</span>”</span>), which is changed to
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mta</span>”</span> (for <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">multithreaded applier</span>”</span>).
      Monitoring tools that work with these instrumentation names might
      be impacted. If the incompatible changes have an impact for you,
      set the <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_terminology_use_previous"><code class="literal">terminology_use_previous</code></a>
      system variable to <code class="literal">BEFORE_8_0_26</code> to make MySQL
      Server use the old versions of the names for the objects specified
      in the previous list. This enables monitoring tools that rely on
      the old names to continue working until they can be updated to use
      the new names.
