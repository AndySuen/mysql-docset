        You can use the
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout"><code class="literal">group_replication_member_expel_timeout</code></a>
        system variable, which is available from MySQL 8.0.13, to allow
        additional time between the creation of a suspicion and the
        expulsion of the suspect member. A suspicion is created when one
        server does not receive messages from another server, as
        explained in
        <a class="xref" href="group-replication-failure-detection.html" title="18.1.4.2 Failure Detection">Section 18.1.4.2, “Failure Detection”</a>.
      </p><p>
        There is an initial 5-second detection period before a Group
        Replication group member creates a suspicion of another member
        (or of itself). A group member is then expelled when another
        member's suspicion of it (or its own suspicion of itself) times
        out. A further short period of time might elapse after that
        before the expelling mechanism detects and implements the
        expulsion.
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout"><code class="literal">group_replication_member_expel_timeout</code></a>
        specifies the period of time in seconds, called the expel
        timeout, that a group member waits between creating a suspicion,
        and expelling the suspected member. Suspect members are listed
        as <code class="literal">UNREACHABLE</code> during this waiting period,
        but are not removed from the group's membership list.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            If a suspect member becomes active again before the
            suspicion times out at the end of the waiting period, the
            member applies all the messages that were buffered by the
            remaining group members in XCom's message cache and enters
            <code class="literal">ONLINE</code> state, without operator
            intervention. In this situation, the member is considered by
            the group as the same incarnation.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If a suspect member becomes active only after the suspicion
            times out and is able to resume communications, it receives
            a view where it is expelled and at that point realises it
            was expelled. You can use the
            <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_autorejoin_tries"><code class="literal">group_replication_autorejoin_tries</code></a>
            system variable, which is available from MySQL 8.0.16, to
            make the member automatically try to rejoin the group at
            this point. From MySQL 8.0.21, this feature is activated by
            default and the member makes three auto-rejoin attempts. If
            the auto-rejoin procedure does not succeed or is not
            attempted, the expelled member then follows the exit action
            specified by
            <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_exit_state_action"><code class="literal">group_replication_exit_state_action</code></a>.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        The waiting period before expelling a member only applies to
        members that have previously been active in the group.
        Non-members that were never active in the group do not get this
        waiting period and are removed after the initial detection
        period because they took too long to join.
      </p><p>
        If
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout"><code class="literal">group_replication_member_expel_timeout</code></a>
        is set to 0, there is no waiting period, and a suspected member
        is liable for expulsion immediately after the 5-second detection
        period ends. This setting is the default up to and including
        MySQL 8.0.20. This is also the behavior of a group member which
        is at a MySQL Server version that does not support the
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout"><code class="literal">group_replication_member_expel_timeout</code></a>
        system variable. From MySQL 8.0.21, the value defaults to 5,
        meaning that a suspected member is liable for expulsion 5
        seconds after the 5-second detection period. It is not mandatory
        for all members of a group to have the same setting for
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout"><code class="literal">group_replication_member_expel_timeout</code></a>,
        but it is recommended in order to avoid unexpected expulsions.
        Any member can create a suspicion of any other member, including
        itself, so the effective expel timeout is that of the member
        with the lowest setting.
      </p><p>
        Consider increasing the value of
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout"><code class="literal">group_replication_member_expel_timeout</code></a>
        from the default in the following scenarios:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            The network is slow and the default 5 or 10 seconds before
            expulsion is not long enough for group members to always
            exchange at least one message.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The network sometimes has transient outages and you want to
            avoid unnecessary expulsions and primary member changes at
            these times.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The network is not under your direct control and you want to
            minimize the need for operator intervention.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            A temporary network outage is expected and you do not want
            some or all of the members to be expelled due to this.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            An individual machine is experiencing a slowdown and you do
            not want it to be expelled from the group.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        You can specify an expel timeout up to a maximum of 3600 seconds
        (1 hour). It is important to ensure that XCom's message cache is
        sufficiently large to contain the expected volume of messages in
        your specified time period, plus the initial 5-second detection
        period, otherwise members cannot reconnect. You can adjust the
        cache size limit using the
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_message_cache_size"><code class="literal">group_replication_message_cache_size</code></a>
        system variable. For more information, see
        <a class="xref" href="group-replication-performance-xcom-cache.html" title="18.7.6 XCom Cache Management">Section 18.7.6, “XCom Cache Management”</a>.
      </p><p>
        If any members in a group are currently under suspicion, the
        group membership cannot be reconfigured (by adding or removing
        members or electing a new leader). If group membership changes
        need to be implemented while one or more members are under
        suspicion, and you want the suspect members to remain in the
        group, take any actions required to make the members active
        again, if that is possible. If you cannot make the members
        active again and you want them to be expelled from the group,
        you can force the suspicions to time out immediately. Do this by
        changing the value of
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout"><code class="literal">group_replication_member_expel_timeout</code></a>
        on any active members to a value lower than the time that has
        already elapsed since the suspicions were created. The suspect
        members then become liable for expulsion immediately.
      </p><p>
        If a replication group member stops unexpectedly and is
        immediately restarted (for example, because it was started with
        <code class="literal">mysqld_safe</code>), it automatically attempts to
        rejoin the group if
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot"><code class="literal">group_replication_start_on_boot=on</code></a>
        is set. In this situation, it is possible for the restart and
        rejoin attempt to take place before the member's previous
        incarnation has been expelled from the group, in which case the
        member cannot rejoin. From MySQL 8.0.19, Group Replication
        automatically uses a Group Communication System (GCS) feature to
        retry the rejoin attempt for the member 10 times, with a
        5-second interval between each retry. This should cover most
        cases and allow enough time for the previous incarnation to be
        expelled from the group, letting the member rejoin. Note that if
        the
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout"><code class="literal">group_replication_member_expel_timeout</code></a>
        system variable is set to specify a longer waiting period before
        the member is expelled, the automatic rejoin attempts might
        still not succeed.
      </p><p>

        expulsions where the
