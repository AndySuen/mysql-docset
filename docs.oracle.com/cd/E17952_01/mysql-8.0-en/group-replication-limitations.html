      The following known limitations exist for Group Replication. Note
      that the limitations and issues described for multi-primary mode
      groups can also apply in single-primary mode clusters during a
      failover event, while the newly elected primary flushes out its
      applier queue from the old primary.

            Up to and including MySQL 8.0.20, Group Replication cannot
            make use of checksums and does not support their presence in
            the binary log, so you must set
            <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_checksum"><code class="literal">binlog_checksum=NONE</code></a> when
            configuring a server instance to become a group member. From
            MySQL 8.0.21, Group Replication supports checksums, so group
            members may use the default setting
            <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_checksum"><code class="literal">binlog_checksum=CRC32</code></a>. The
            setting for <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_checksum"><code class="literal">binlog_checksum</code></a>
            does not have to be the same for all members of a group.
          </p><p>
          When checksums are available, Group Replication does not use
          them to verify incoming events on the
          <code class="literal">group_replication_applier</code> channel, because
          events are written to that relay log from multiple sources and
          before they are actually written to the originating server's
          binary log, which is when a checksum is generated. Checksums
          are used to verify the integrity of events on the
          <code class="literal">group_replication_recovery</code> channel and on
          any other replication channels on group members.

            Setting a transaction isolation level to
            <code class="literal">SERIALIZABLE</code> configures Group Replication
            to refuse to commit the transaction.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><strong>Concurrent DDL versus DML Operations. </strong>
            Concurrent data definition statements and data manipulation
            statements executing against the same object but on
            different servers is not supported when using multi-primary
            mode. During execution of Data Definition Language (DDL)
            statements on an object, executing concurrent Data
            Manipulation Language (DML) on the same object but on a
            different server instance has the risk of conflicting DDL
            executing on different instances not being detected.

            Multi-primary mode groups (members all configured with

            <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_foreign_key_constraint" title="FOREIGN KEY constraint"> foreign key
            constraints</a>. This is because foreign key constraints
            that result in cascading operations executed by a
            multi-primary mode group can result in undetected conflicts
            and lead to inconsistent data across the members of the

            avoid undetected conflicts.
          </p><p>
          In single-primary mode this is not a problem as it does not
          allow concurrent writes to multiple members of the group and
          thus there is no risk of undetected conflicts.

            <code class="literal">SELECT .. FOR UPDATE</code> statements can
            result in a deadlock. This is because the lock is not shared
            across the members of the group, therefore the expectation
            for such a statement might not be reached.

            Global replication filters cannot be used on a MySQL server
            instance that is configured for Group Replication, because
            filtering transactions on some servers would make the group
            unable to reach agreement on a consistent state. Channel
            specific replication filters can be used on replication
            channels that are not directly involved with Group
            Replication, such as where a group member also acts as a
            replica to a source that is outside the group. They cannot
            be used on the <code class="literal">group_replication_applier</code>

            Support for the TLSv1.3 protocol is available in MySQL
            Server as of MySQL 8.0.16, provided that MySQL was compiled
            using OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher. In MySQL 8.0.16 and MySQL
            8.0.17, if the server supports TLSv1.3, the protocol is not
            supported in the group communication engine and cannot be
            used by Group Replication. Group Replication supports
            TLSv1.3 from MySQL 8.0.18, where it can be used for group
            communication connections and distributed recovery
            connections.
          </p><p>
          In MySQL 8.0.18, TLSv1.3 can be used in Group Replication for
          the distributed recovery connection, but the

            Group Replication initiates and manages cloning operations
            for distributed recovery, but group members that have been
            set up to support cloning may also participate in cloning
            operations that a user initiates manually. In releases
            before MySQL 8.0.20, you cannot initiate a cloning operation
            manually if the operation involves a group member on which
            Group Replication is running. From MySQL 8.0.20, you can do
            this, provided that the cloning operation does not remove
            and replace the data on the recipient. The statement to
            initiate the cloning operation must therefore include the
            <code class="literal">DATA DIRECTORY</code> clause if Group
            Replication is running. See

        The maximum number of MySQL servers that can be members of a
        single replication group is 9. If further members attempt to
        join the group, their request is refused. This limit has been
        identified from testing and benchmarking as a safe boundary
        where the group performs reliably on a stable local area

        If an individual transaction results in message contents which
        are large enough that the message cannot be copied between group
        members over the network within a 5-second window, members can
        be suspected of having failed, and then expelled, just because
        they are busy processing the transaction. Large transactions can
        also cause the system to slow due to problems with memory
        allocation. To avoid these issues use the following mitigations:

            Where possible, try and limit the size of your transactions

            143 MB). Transactions above this size are rolled back and
            are not sent to Group Replication's Group Communication
            System (GCS) for distribution to the group. Adjust the value
            of this variable depending on the maximum message size that
            you need the group to tolerate, bearing in mind that the
            time taken to process a transaction is proportional to its
            size.

            MB), so large messages are automatically compressed.
            Compression is carried out by Group Replication's Group

            fragmented. This system variable defaults to 10485760 bytes
            (10 MiB), so large messages are automatically fragmented.
            GCS carries out fragmentation after compression if the
            compressed message still exceeds the

            fragmentation, all group members must be at MySQL 8.0.16 or
            above, and the Group Replication communication protocol
            version in use by the group must allow fragmentation. For
            more information, see

        The maximum transaction size, message compression, and message
        fragmentation can all be deactivated by specifying a zero value
        for the relevant system variable. If you have deactivated all
        these safeguards, the upper size limit for a message that can be
        handled by the applier thread on a member of a replication group
        is the value of the member's

        variable, which have a default and maximum value of 1073741824
        bytes (1 GB). A message that exceeds this limit fails when the

        a message that a group member can originate and attempt to
        transmit to the group is 4294967295 bytes (approximately 4 GB).
        This is a hard limit on the packet size that is accepted by the
        group communication engine for Group Replication (XCom, a Paxos
        variant), which receives messages after GCS has handled them. A
