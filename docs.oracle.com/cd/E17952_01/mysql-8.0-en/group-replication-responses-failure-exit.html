        The
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_exit_state_action"><code class="literal">group_replication_exit_state_action</code></a>
        system variable, which is available from MySQL 8.0.12 and MySQL
        5.7.24, specifies what Group Replication does when the member
        leaves the group unintentionally due to an error or problem, and
        either fails to auto-rejoin or does not try. Note that in the
        case of an expelled member, the member does not know that it was
        expelled until it reconnects to the group, so the specified
        action is only taken if the member manages to reconnect, or if
        the member raises a suspicion on itself and expels itself.
      </p><p>
        In order of impact, the exit actions are as follows:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
            If <code class="literal">READ_ONLY</code> is the exit action, the
            instance switches MySQL to super read only mode by setting
            the system variable
            <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_super_read_only"><code class="literal">super_read_only</code></a> to
            <code class="literal">ON</code>. When the member is in super read only
            mode, clients cannot make any updates, even if they have the
            <a class="link" href="privileges-provided.html#priv_connection-admin"><code class="literal">CONNECTION_ADMIN</code></a> privilege
            (or the deprecated
            <a class="link" href="privileges-provided.html#priv_super"><code class="literal">SUPER</code></a>
            privilege). However, clients can still read data, and
            because updates are no longer being made, there is a
            probability of stale reads which increases over time. With
            this setting, you therefore need to pro-actively monitor the
            servers for failures. This exit action is the default from
            MySQL 8.0.15. After this exit action is taken, the member's
            status is displayed as <code class="literal">ERROR</code> in the view
            of the group.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If <code class="literal">OFFLINE_MODE</code> is the exit action, the
            instance switches MySQL to offline mode by setting the
            system variable
            <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_offline_mode"><code class="literal">offline_mode</code></a> to
            <code class="literal">ON</code>. When the member is in offline mode,
            connected client users are disconnected on their next
            request and connections are no longer accepted, with the
            exception of client users that have the
            <a class="link" href="privileges-provided.html#priv_connection-admin"><code class="literal">CONNECTION_ADMIN</code></a> privilege
            (or the deprecated
            <a class="link" href="privileges-provided.html#priv_super"><code class="literal">SUPER</code></a>
            privilege). Group Replication also sets the system variable
            <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_super_read_only"><code class="literal">super_read_only</code></a> to
            <code class="literal">ON</code>, so clients cannot make any updates,
            even if they have connected with the
            <a class="link" href="privileges-provided.html#priv_connection-admin"><code class="literal">CONNECTION_ADMIN</code></a> or
            <a class="link" href="privileges-provided.html#priv_super"><code class="literal">SUPER</code></a>
            privilege. This exit action prevents both updates and stale
            reads (with the exception of reads by client users with the
            stated privileges), and enables proxy tools such as MySQL
            Router to recognize that the server is unavailable and
            redirect client connections. It also leaves the instance
            running so that an administrator can attempt to resolve the
            issue without shutting down MySQL. This exit action is
            available from MySQL 8.0.18. After this exit action is
            taken, the member's status is displayed as
            <code class="literal">ERROR</code> in the view of the group (not
            <code class="literal">OFFLINE</code>, which means a member has Group
            Replication functionality available but does not currently
            belong to a group).
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If <code class="literal">ABORT_SERVER</code> is the exit action, the
            instance shuts down MySQL. Instructing the member to shut
            itself down prevents all stale reads and client updates, but
            it means that the MySQL Server instance is unavailable and
            must be restarted, even if the issue could have been
            resolved without that step. This exit action was the default
            from MySQL 8.0.12, when the system variable was added, to
            MySQL 8.0.15 inclusive. After this exit action is taken, the
            member is removed from the listing of servers in the view of
            the group.
          </p></li></ol></div><p>
        Bear in mind that operator intervention is required whatever
        exit action is set, as an ex-member that has exhausted its
        auto-rejoin attempts (or never had any) and has been expelled
        from the group is not allowed to rejoin without a restart of
        Group Replication. The exit action only influences whether or
        not clients can still read data on the server that was unable to
        rejoin the group, and whether or not the server stays running.
      </p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><div class="admon-title">Important</div><p>
          If a failure occurs before the member has successfully joined
          the group, the exit action specified by
          <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_exit_state_action"><code class="literal">group_replication_exit_state_action</code></a>
          <span class="emphasis"><em>is not taken</em></span>. This is the case if there
          is a failure during the local configuration check, or a
          mismatch between the configuration of the joining member and
          the configuration of the group. In these situations, the
          <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_super_read_only"><code class="literal">super_read_only</code></a>
          system variable is left with its original value, and the
          server does not shut down MySQL. To ensure that the server
          cannot accept updates when Group Replication did not start, we
          therefore recommend that
          <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_super_read_only"><code class="literal">super_read_only=ON</code></a>
          is set in the server's configuration file at startup, which
          Group Replication changes to <code class="literal">OFF</code> on primary
          members after it has been started successfully. This safeguard
          is particularly important when the server is configured to
          start Group Replication on server boot
          (<a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot"><code class="literal">group_replication_start_on_boot=ON</code></a>),
          but it is also useful when Group Replication is started
          manually using a <a class="link" href="start-group-replication.html" title="13.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement"><code class="literal">START
          GROUP_REPLICATION</code></a> command.
        </p></div><p>
        If a failure occurs after the member has successfully joined the
        group, the specified exit action is taken. This is the case in
        the following situations:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>

            Group Replication retries distributed recovery automatically

            options to complete the process. For details, see
