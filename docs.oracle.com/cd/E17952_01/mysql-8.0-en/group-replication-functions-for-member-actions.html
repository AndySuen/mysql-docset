        The following functions can be used to enable and disable
        actions for members of a group to take in specified situations,
        and to reset the configuration to the default setting for all
        member actions. They can only be used by administrators with the
        <a class="link" href="privileges-provided.html#priv_group-replication-admin"><code class="literal">GROUP_REPLICATION_ADMIN</code></a> privilege
        or the deprecated <a class="link" href="privileges-provided.html#priv_super"><code class="literal">SUPER</code></a>
        privilege.
      </p><p>
        You configure member actions on the group’s primary using the
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.html#function_group-replication-enable-member-action"><code class="literal">group_replication_enable_member_action</code></a>
        and
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.html#function_group-replication-disable-member-action"><code class="literal">group_replication_disable_member_action</code></a>
        functions. The member actions configuration, consisting of all
        the member actions and whether they are enabled or disabled, is
        then propagated to other group members and joining members using
        Group Replication’s group messages. This means that the group
        members will all act in the same way when they are in the
        specified situation, and you only need to use the function on
        the primary.
      </p><p>
        The functions can also be used on a server that is not part of a
        group, as long as the Group Replication plugin is installed. In
        that case, the member actions configuration is not propagated to
        any other servers.
      </p><p>
        The
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.html#function_group-replication-reset-member-actions"><code class="literal">group_replication_reset_member_actions</code></a>
        function can only be used on a server that is not part of a
        group. It resets the member actions configuration to the default
        settings, and resets its version number. The server must be
        writeable (with the <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_read_only"><code class="literal">read_only</code></a>
        system variable set to <code class="literal">OFF</code>) and have the
        Group Replication plugin installed.
      </p><p>
        The available member actions are as follows:
      </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">
            <code class="literal">mysql_disable_super_read_only_if_primary</code>
          </span></dt><dd><p>
              This member action is available from MySQL 8.0.26. It is
              taken after a member is elected as the group’s primary,
              which is the event
              <code class="literal">AFTER_PRIMARY_ELECTION</code>. The member
              action is enabled by default. You can disable it using the
              <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.html#function_group-replication-disable-member-action"><code class="literal">group_replication_disable_member_action()</code></a>
              function, and re-enable it using the
              <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.html#function_group-replication-enable-member-action"><code class="literal">group_replication_enable_member_action()</code></a>
              function.
            </p><p>
              When this member action is enabled and taken, super
              read-only mode is disabled on the primary, so that the
              primary becomes read-write and accepts updates from a
              replication source server and from clients. This is the
              normal situation.
            </p><p>
              When this member action is disabled and not taken, the
              primary remains in super read-only mode after election. In
              this state, it does not accept updates from any clients,
              even users who have the
              <a class="link" href="privileges-provided.html#priv_connection-admin"><code class="literal">CONNECTION_ADMIN</code></a> or
              <a class="link" href="privileges-provided.html#priv_super"><code class="literal">SUPER</code></a>
              privilege. It does continue to accept updates performed by
              replication threads. This setup means that when a
              group’s purpose is to provide a secondary backup to
              another group for disaster tolerance, you can ensure that
              the secondary group remains synchronized with the first.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">

          </span></dt><dd><p>
              This member action is available from MySQL 8.0.27. It is
              taken after a member is elected as the group’s primary,
              which is the event
              <code class="literal">AFTER_PRIMARY_ELECTION</code>. The member
              action is enabled by default. You can disable it using the
              <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.html#function_group-replication-disable-member-action"><code class="literal">group_replication_disable_member_action()</code></a>
              function, and re-enable it using the
              <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.html#function_group-replication-enable-member-action"><code class="literal">group_replication_enable_member_action()</code></a>
              function.
            </p><p>
              When this member action is enabled, asynchronous
              connection failover for replicas is active for a
              replication channel on a Group Replication primary when
              you set
              <code class="literal">SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER=1</code> on
              the <a class="link" href="change-replication-source-to.html" title="13.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement"><code class="literal">CHANGE
              REPLICATION SOURCE TO</code></a> statement for the channel.
              When the feature is active and correctly configured, if
              the primary that is replicating goes offline or into an
              error state, the new primary starts replication on the
              same channel when it is elected. This is the normal
              situation. For instructions to configure the feature, see
              <a class="xref" href="replication-asynchronous-connection-failover-replica.html" title="17.4.9.2 Asynchronous Connection Failover for Replicas">Section 17.4.9.2, “Asynchronous Connection Failover for Replicas”</a>.
            </p><p>
              When this member action is disabled, asynchronous
              connection failover does not take place for the replicas.
              If the primary goes offline or into an error state,
              replication stops for the channel. Note that if there is
              more than one channel with
              <code class="literal">SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER=1</code>, the
              member action covers all the channels, so they cannot be
              individually enabled and disabled by this method. Set
              <code class="literal">SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER=0</code> to
              disable an individual channel.

            Enable a member action for the member to take in the
            specified situation. If the server where you use the
            function is part of a group, it must be the current primary

            the majority. The changed setting is propagated to other

            the same way when they are in the specified situation, and
