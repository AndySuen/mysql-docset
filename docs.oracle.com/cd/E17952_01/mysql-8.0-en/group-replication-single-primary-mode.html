        In single-primary mode
        (<a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_single_primary_mode"><code class="literal">group_replication_single_primary_mode=ON</code></a>)
        the group has a single primary server that is set to read-write
        mode. All the other members in the group are set to read-only
        mode (with <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_super_read_only"><code class="literal">super_read_only=ON</code></a>).
        The primary is typically the first server to bootstrap the
        group. All other servers that join the group learn about the
        primary server and are automatically set to read-only mode.
      </p><p>
        In single-primary mode, Group Replication enforces that only a
        single server writes to the group, so compared to multi-primary
        mode, consistency checking can be less strict and DDL statements
        do not need to be handled with any extra care. The option
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_enforce_update_everywhere_checks"><code class="literal">group_replication_enforce_update_everywhere_checks</code></a>
        enables or disables strict consistency checks for a group. When
        deploying in single-primary mode, or changing the group to
        single-primary mode, this system variable must be set to
        <code class="literal">OFF</code>.
      </p><p>
        The member that is designated as the primary server can change
        in the following ways:

        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              If the existing primary leaves the group, whether
              voluntarily or unexpectedly, a new primary is elected
              automatically.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              You can appoint a specific member as the new primary using
              the
              <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-new-primary.html#function_group-replication-set-as-primary"><code class="literal">group_replication_set_as_primary()</code></a>
              function.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              If you use the
              <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-mode.html#function_group-replication-switch-to-single-primary-mode"><code class="literal">group_replication_switch_to_single_primary_mode()</code></a>
              function to change a group that was running in
              multi-primary mode to run in single-primary mode, a new
              primary is elected automatically, or you can appoint the
              new primary by specifying it with the function.
            </p></li></ul></div><p>

        The functions can only be used when all group members are
        running MySQL 8.0.13 or higher. When a new primary server is
        elected automatically or appointed manually, it is automatically
        set to read-write, and the other group members remain as
        secondaries, and as such, read-only.
        <a class="xref" href="group-replication-single-primary-mode.html#group-replication-primary-election-diagram" title="Figure 18.4 New Primary Election">Figure 18.4, “New Primary Election”</a>
        shows this process.
      </p><div class="figure"><a id="group-replication-primary-election-diagram"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 18.4 New Primary Election</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/single-primary-election.png" width="899" height="356" alt="Five server instances, S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5, are deployed as an interconnected group. Server S1 is the primary. Write clients are communicating with server S1, and a read client is communicating with server S4. Server S1 then fails, breaking communication with the write clients. Server S2 then takes over as the new primary, and the write clients now communicate with server S2." /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>
        When a new primary is elected or appointed, it might have a
        backlog of changes that had been applied on the old primary but
        have not yet been applied on this server. In this situation,
        until the new primary catches up with the old primary,
        read-write transactions might result in conflicts and be rolled
        back, and read-only transactions might result in stale reads.
        Group Replication's flow control mechanism, which minimizes the
        difference between fast and slow members, reduces the chances of
        this happening if it is activated and properly tuned. For more
        information on flow control, see
        <a class="xref" href="group-replication-flow-control.html" title="18.7.2 Flow Control">Section 18.7.2, “Flow Control”</a>. From MySQL
        8.0.14, you can also use the
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_consistency"><code class="literal">group_replication_consistency</code></a>
        system variable to configure the group's level of transaction
        consistency to prevent this issue. The setting
        <code class="literal">BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER</code> (or any higher
        consistency level) holds new transactions on a newly elected
        primary until the backlog has been applied. For more information
        on transaction consistency, see
        <a class="xref" href="group-replication-consistency-guarantees.html" title="18.5.3 Transaction Consistency Guarantees">Section 18.5.3, “Transaction Consistency Guarantees”</a>. If
        flow control and transaction consistency guarantees are not used
        for a group, it is a good practice to wait for the new primary
        to apply its replication-related relay log before re-routing
        client applications to it.

          The automatic primary member election process involves each
          member looking at the new view of the group, ordering the
          potential new primary members, and choosing the member that
          qualifies as the most suitable. Each member makes its own
          decision locally, following the primary election algorithm in
          its MySQL Server release. Because all members must reach the
          same decision, members adapt their primary election algorithm
          if other group members are running lower MySQL Server
          versions, so that they have the same behavior as the member
          with the lowest MySQL Server version in the group.
        </p><p>
          The factors considered by members when electing a primary, in
          order, are as follows:

          </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
                The first factor considered is which member or members
                are running the lowest MySQL Server version. If all
                group members are running MySQL 8.0.17 or higher,
                members are first ordered by the patch version of their
                release. If any members are running MySQL Server 5.7 or
                MySQL 8.0.16 or lower, members are first ordered by the
                major version of their release, and the patch version is
                ignored.
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                If more than one member is running the lowest MySQL
                Server version, the second factor considered is the
                member weight of each of those members, as specified by
                the
                <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_member_weight"><code class="literal">group_replication_member_weight</code></a>
                system variable on the member. If any member of the
                group is running MySQL Server 5.7, where this system
                variable was not available, this factor is ignored.
              </p><p>
                The
                <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_member_weight"><code class="literal">group_replication_member_weight</code></a>
                system variable specifies a number in the range 0-100.
                All members default to a weight of 50, so set a weight
                below this to lower their ordering, and a weight above
                it to increase their ordering. You can use this
                weighting function to prioritize the use of better
                hardware or to ensure failover to a specific member
                during scheduled maintenance of the primary.
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                If more than one member is running the lowest MySQL
                Server version, and more than one of those members has
                the highest member weight (or member weighting is being
                ignored), the third factor considered is the
                lexicographical order of the generated server UUIDs of
                each member, as specified by the
                <a class="link" href="replication-options.html#sysvar_server_uuid"><code class="literal">server_uuid</code></a> system
                variable. The member with the lowest server UUID is
                chosen as the primary. This factor acts as a guaranteed
                and predictable tie-breaker so that all group members
                reach the same decision if it cannot be determined by
                any important factors.
