      As the number of replicas connecting to a source increases, the
      load, although minimal, also increases, as each replica uses a
      client connection to the source. Also, as each replica must
      receive a full copy of the source's binary log, the network load
      on the source may also increase and create a bottleneck.
    </p><p>
      If you are using a large number of replicas connected to one
      source, and that source is also busy processing requests (for
      example, as part of a scale-out solution), then you may want to
      improve the performance of the replication process.
    </p><p>
      One way to improve the performance of the replication process is
      to create a deeper replication structure that enables the source
      to replicate to only one replica, and for the remaining replicas
      to connect to this primary replica for their individual
      replication requirements. A sample of this structure is shown in
      <a class="xref" href="replication-solutions-performance.html#figure_replication-performance" title="Figure 17.3 Using an Additional Replication Source to Improve Performance">Figure 17.3, “Using an Additional Replication Source to Improve Performance”</a>.
    </p><div class="figure"><a id="figure_replication-performance"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 17.3 Using an Additional Replication Source to Improve Performance</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/subsource-performance.png" width="370" height="238" alt="The server MySQL Source 1 replicates to the server MySQL Source 2, which in turn replicates to the servers MySQL Replica 1, MySQL Replica 2, and MySQL Replica 3." /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>
      For this to work, you must configure the MySQL instances as
      follows:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          Source 1 is the primary source where all changes and updates
          are written to the database. Binary logging is enabled on both
          source servers, which is the default.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Source 2 is the replica to the server Source 1 that provides
          the replication functionality to the remainder of the replicas
          in the replication structure. Source 2 is the only machine
          permitted to connect to Source 1. Source 2 has the
          <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_log_slave_updates"><code class="option">--log-slave-updates</code></a> option
          enabled (which is the default). With this option, replication
          instructions from Source 1 are also written to Source 2's
          binary log so that they can then be replicated to the true
          replicas.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Replica 1, Replica 2, and Replica 3 act as replicas to Source
          2, and replicate the information from Source 2, which actually
          consists of the upgrades logged on Source 1.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      The above solution reduces the client load and the network
      interface load on the primary source, which should improve the
      overall performance of the primary source when used as a direct
      database solution.
    </p><p>
      If your replicas are having trouble keeping up with the
      replication process on the source, there are a number of options
      available:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          If possible, put the relay logs and the data files on
          different physical drives. To do this, set the
          <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_relay_log"><code class="literal">relay_log</code></a> system variable to
          specify the location of the relay log.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If heavy disk I/O activity for reads of the binary log file
          and relay log files is an issue, consider increasing the value
          of the <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_rpl_read_size"><code class="literal">rpl_read_size</code></a> system
          variable. This system variable controls the minimum amount of
          data read from the log files, and increasing it might reduce
          file reads and I/O stalls when the file data is not currently
          cached by the operating system. Note that a buffer the size of
          this value is allocated for each thread that reads from the
          binary log and relay log files, including dump threads on
          sources and coordinator threads on replicas. Setting a large
          value might therefore have an impact on memory consumption for
          servers.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If the replicas are significantly slower than the source, you
          may want to divide up the responsibility for replicating
          different databases to different replicas. See
          <a class="xref" href="replication-solutions-partitioning.html" title="17.4.6 Replicating Different Databases to Different Replicas">Section 17.4.6, “Replicating Different Databases to Different Replicas”</a>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If your source makes use of transactions and you are not
          concerned about transaction support on your replicas, use
          <code class="literal">MyISAM</code> or another nontransactional engine
          on the replicas. See
          <a class="xref" href="replication-solutions-diffengines.html" title="17.4.4 Using Replication with Different Source and Replica Storage Engines">Section 17.4.4, “Using Replication with Different Source and Replica Storage Engines”</a>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If your replicas are not acting as sources, and you have a
          potential solution in place to ensure that you can bring up a
          source in the event of failure, then you can disable the
          system variable
          <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_log_replica_updates"><code class="literal">log_replica_updates</code></a> (from
          MySQL 8.0.26) or
          <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_log_slave_updates"><code class="literal">log_slave_updates</code></a> (before
          MySQL 8.0.26) on the replicas. This prevents
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">dumb</span>”</span> replicas from also logging events they
          have executed into their own binary log.
