        During an online upgrade procedure, if the group is in
        single-primary mode, all the servers that are not currently
        offline for upgrading function as they did before. The group
        elects a new primary whenever necessary, following the election
        policies described in
        <a class="xref" href="group-replication-single-primary-mode.html" title="18.1.3.1 Single-Primary Mode">Section 18.1.3.1, “Single-Primary Mode”</a>. Note
        that if you require the primary to remain the same throughout
        (except when it is being upgraded itself), you must first
        upgrade all of the secondaries to a version higher than or equal
        to the target primary member version, then upgrade the primary
        last. The primary cannot remain as the primary unless it is
        running the lowest MySQL Server version in the group. After the
        primary has been upgraded, you can use the
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-new-primary.html#function_group-replication-set-as-primary"><code class="literal">group_replication_set_as_primary()</code></a>
        function to reappoint it as the primary.
      </p><p>
        If the group is in multi-primary mode, fewer online members are
        available to perform writes during the upgrade procedure,
        because upgraded members join in read-only mode after their
        upgrade. From MySQL 8.0.17, this applies to upgrades between
        patch versions, and for lower releases, this only applies to
        upgrades between major versions. When all members have been
        upgraded to the same release, from MySQL 8.0.17, they all change
        back to read-write mode automatically. For earlier releases, you
        must set <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_super_read_only"><code class="literal">super_read_only</code></a> to
        <code class="literal">OFF</code> manually on each member that should
        function as a primary following the upgrade.
      </p><p>
        To deal with a problem situation, for example if you have to
        roll back an upgrade or add extra capacity to a group in an
        emergency, it is possible to allow a member to join an online
        group although it is running a lower MySQL Server version than
        the lowest version in use by other group members. The Group
        Replication system variable
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_allow_local_lower_version_join"><code class="literal">group_replication_allow_local_lower_version_join</code></a>
        can be used in such situations to override the normal
        compatibility policies. It is important to note that setting the
        option to <code class="literal">ON</code> does not make the new member
        compatible with the group, and allows it to join the group
        without any safeguards against incompatible behaviors by the
        existing members. The option must therefore only be used
        carefully in specific situations, and you must take additional
        precautions to avoid the new member failing due to normal group
        activity. For details of these precautions, see the description
        for
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_allow_local_lower_version_join"><code class="literal">group_replication_allow_local_lower_version_join</code></a>.
