        Group Replication’s failure detection mechanism is a
        distributed service which is able to identify that a server in
        the group is not communicating with the others, and is therefore
        suspected of being out of service. If the group’s consensus is
        that the suspicion is probably true, the group takes a
        coordinated decision to expel the member. Expelling a member
        that is not communicating is necessary because the group needs a
        majority of its members to agree on a transaction or view
        change. If a member is not participating in these decisions, the
        group must remove it to increase the chance that the group
        contains a majority of correctly working members, and can
        therefore continue to process transactions.
      </p><p>
        In a replication group, each member has a point-to-point
        communication channel to each other member, creating a fully
        connected graph. These connections are managed by the group
        communication engine (XCom, a Paxos variant) and use TCP/IP
        sockets. One channel is used to send messages to the member and
        the other channel is used to receive messages from the member.
        If a member does not receive messages from another member for 5
        seconds, it suspects that the member has failed, and lists the
        status of that member as <code class="literal">UNREACHABLE</code> in its
        own Performance Schema table
        <a class="link" href="performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.html" title="27.12.11.11 The replication_group_members Table"><code class="literal">replication_group_members</code></a>.
        Usually, two members will suspect each other of having failed
        because they are each not communicating with the other. It is
        possible, though less likely, that member A suspects member B of
        having failed but member B does not suspect member A of having
        failed - perhaps due to a routing or firewall issue. A member
        can also create a suspicion of itself. A member that is isolated
        from the rest of the group suspects that all the others have
        failed.
      </p><p>
        If a suspicion lasts for more than 10 seconds, the suspecting
        member tries to propagate its view that the suspect member is
        faulty to the other members of the group. A suspecting member
        only does this if it is a notifier, as calculated from its
        internal XCom node number. If a member is actually isolated from
        the rest of the group, it might attempt to propagate its view,
        but that will have no consequences as it cannot secure a quorum
        of the other members to agree on it. A suspicion only has
        consequences if a member is a notifier, and its suspicion lasts
        long enough to be propagated to the other members of the group,
        and the other members agree on it. In that case, the suspect
        member is marked for expulsion from the group in a coordinated
        decision, and is expelled after the waiting period set by the
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout"><code class="literal">group_replication_member_expel_timeout</code></a>
        system variable expires and the expelling mechanism detects and
        implements the expulsion.
      </p><p>
        Where the network is unstable and members frequently lose and
        regain connection to each other in different combinations, it is
        theoretically possible for a group to end up marking all its
        members for expulsion, after which the group would cease to
        exist and have to be set up again. To counter this possibility,
        from MySQL 8.0.20, Group Replication's Group Communication
        System (GCS) tracks the group members that have been marked for
        expulsion, and treats them as if they were in the group of
        suspected members when deciding if there is a majority. This
        ensures at least one member remains in the group and the group
        can continue to exist. When an expelled member has actually been
        removed from the group, GCS removes its record of having marked
        the member for expulsion, so that the member can rejoin the
        group if it is able to.

        you can configure to specify the responses of working group
        members to failure situations, and the actions taken by group
