        This section describes ways to configure storage devices when
        you can devote more and faster storage hardware to the database
        server. For information about optimizing an
        <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> configuration to improve I/O
        performance, see <a class="xref" href="optimizing-innodb-diskio.html" title="8.5.8 Optimizing InnoDB Disk I/O">Section 8.5.8, “Optimizing InnoDB Disk I/O”</a>.

            Disk seeks are a huge performance bottleneck. This problem
            becomes more apparent when the amount of data starts to grow
            so large that effective caching becomes impossible. For
            large databases where you access data more or less randomly,
            you can be sure that you need at least one disk seek to read
            and a couple of disk seeks to write things. To minimize this
            problem, use disks with low seek times.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Increase the number of available disk spindles (and thereby
            reduce the seek overhead) by either symlinking files to
            different disks or striping the disks:
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>
                Using symbolic links
              </p><p>
                This means that, for <code class="literal">MyISAM</code> tables,
                you symlink the index file and data files from their
                usual location in the data directory to another disk
                (that may also be striped). This makes both the seek and
                read times better, assuming that the disk is not used
                for other purposes as well. See
                <a class="xref" href="symbolic-links.html" title="8.12.2 Using Symbolic Links">Section 8.12.2, “Using Symbolic Links”</a>.
              </p><p>
                Symbolic links are not supported for use with
                <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> tables. However, it is
                possible to place <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> data and log
                files on different physical disks. For more information,
                see <a class="xref" href="optimizing-innodb-diskio.html" title="8.5.8 Optimizing InnoDB Disk I/O">Section 8.5.8, “Optimizing InnoDB Disk I/O”</a>.

                Striping
              </p><p>
                Striping means that you have many disks and put the
                first block on the first disk, the second block on the
                second disk, and the <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em>-th
                block on the (<code class="literal"><em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em> MOD
                <em class="replaceable"><code>number_of_disks</code></em></code>)
                disk, and so on. This means if your normal data size is
                less than the stripe size (or perfectly aligned), you
                get much better performance. Striping is very dependent
                on the operating system and the stripe size, so
                benchmark your application with different stripe sizes.
                See <a class="xref" href="custom-benchmarks.html" title="8.13.2 Using Your Own Benchmarks">Section 8.13.2, “Using Your Own Benchmarks”</a>.
              </p><p>
                The speed difference for striping is
                <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> dependent on the parameters.
                Depending on how you set the striping parameters and
                number of disks, you may get differences measured in
                orders of magnitude. You have to choose to optimize for
                random or sequential access.
              </p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            For reliability, you may want to use RAID 0+1 (striping plus
            mirroring), but in this case, you need 2 ×
            <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em> drives to hold
            <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em> drives of data. This is
            probably the best option if you have the money for it.
            However, you may also have to invest in some
            volume-management software to handle it efficiently.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            A good option is to vary the RAID level according to how
            critical a type of data is. For example, store
            semi-important data that can be regenerated on a RAID 0
            disk, but store really important data such as host
            information and logs on a RAID 0+1 or RAID
            <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em> disk. RAID
            <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em> can be a problem if you have
            many writes, due to the time required to update the parity
            bits.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            You can also set the parameters for the file system that the
            database uses:
          </p><p>
            If you do not need to know when files were last accessed
            (which is not really useful on a database server), you can
            mount your file systems with the <code class="option">-o noatime</code>
            option. That skips updates to the last access time in inodes
            on the file system, which avoids some disk seeks.
          </p><p>
            On many operating systems, you can set a file system to be
            updated asynchronously by mounting it with the <code class="option">-o
            async</code> option. If your computer is reasonably
            stable, this should give you better performance without
            sacrificing too much reliability. (This flag is on by
            default on Linux.)
          </p></li></ul></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="disk-issues-nfs"></a>Using NFS with MySQL</h4></div></div></div><p>
          You should be cautious when considering whether to use NFS
          with MySQL. Potential issues, which vary by operating system
          and NFS version, include the following:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              MySQL data and log files placed on NFS volumes becoming
              locked and unavailable for use. Locking issues may occur
              in cases where multiple instances of MySQL access the same
              data directory or where MySQL is shut down improperly, due
              to a power outage, for example. NFS version 4 addresses
              underlying locking issues with the introduction of
              advisory and lease-based locking. However, sharing a data
              directory among MySQL instances is not recommended.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Data inconsistencies introduced due to messages received
              out of order or lost network traffic. To avoid this issue,
              use TCP with <code class="literal">hard</code> and
              <code class="literal">intr</code> mount options.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Maximum file size limitations. NFS Version 2 clients can
              only access the lowest 2GB of a file (signed 32 bit
              offset). NFS Version 3 clients support larger files (up to
              64 bit offsets). The maximum supported file size also
              depends on the local file system of the NFS server.
            </p></li></ul></div><p>
          Using NFS within a professional SAN environment or other
          storage system tends to offer greater reliability than using
          NFS outside of such an environment. However, NFS within a SAN
          environment may be slower than directly attached or
          bus-attached non-rotational storage.
        </p><p>
          If you choose to use NFS, NFS Version 4 or later is
          recommended, as is testing your NFS setup thoroughly before
          deploying into a production environment.
