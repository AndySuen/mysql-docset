        When binary log encryption is active for a MySQL server
        instance, the encryption coverage is as follows:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            Data at rest that is written to the binary log files and
            relay log files is encrypted from the point in time where
            encryption is started, using the two tier encryption
            architecture described above. Existing binary log files and
            relay log files that were present on the server when you
            started encryption are not encrypted. You can purge these
            files when they are no longer needed.

            Data in motion in the replication event stream, which is
            sent to MySQL clients including
            <a class="link" href="mysqlbinlog.html" title="4.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"><span class="command"><strong>mysqlbinlog</strong></span></a>, is decrypted for
            transmission, and should therefore be protected in transit
            by the use of connection encryption (see
            <a class="xref" href="encrypted-connections.html" title="6.3 Using Encrypted Connections">Section 6.3, “Using Encrypted Connections”</a> and
            <a class="xref" href="replication-encrypted-connections.html" title="17.3.1 Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections">Section 17.3.1, “Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections”</a>).
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Data in use that is held in the binary log transaction and
            statement caches during a transaction is in unencrypted
            format in the memory buffer that stores the cache. The data
            is written to a temporary file on disk if it exceeds the
            space available in the memory buffer. From MySQL 8.0.17,
            when binary log encryption is active on the server,
            temporary files used to hold the binary log cache are
            encrypted using AES-CTR (AES Counter mode) for stream
            encryption. Because the temporary files are volatile and
            tied to a single process, they are encrypted using
            single-tier encryption, using a randomly generated file
            password and initialization vector that exist only in memory
            and are never stored on disk or in the keyring. After each
            transaction is committed, the binary log cache is reset: the
            memory buffer is cleared, any temporary file used to hold
            the binary log cache is truncated, and a new file password
            and initialization vector are randomly generated for use
            with the next transaction. This reset also takes place when
            the server is restarted after a normal shutdown or an
            unexpected halt.

          <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format=STATEMENT</code></a> is
          set, which is not recommended as the statement is considered
          unsafe for statement-based replication, a temporary file
          containing the data is created on the replica where the
          changes are applied. These temporary files are not encrypted
          when binary log encryption is active on the server. Use
          row-based or mixed binary logging format instead, which do not
          create the temporary files.
