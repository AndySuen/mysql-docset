        This section provides guidelines on setting thread pool system
        variables for best performance, measured using a metric such as
        transactions per second.
      </p><p>
        <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_pool_size"><code class="literal">thread_pool_size</code></a> is the most
        important parameter controlling thread pool performance. It can
        be set only at server startup. Our experience in testing the
        thread pool indicates the following:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            If the primary storage engine is
            <a class="link" href="innodb-storage-engine.html" title="Chapter 15 The InnoDB Storage Engine"><code class="literal">InnoDB</code></a>, the optimal
            <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_pool_size"><code class="literal">thread_pool_size</code></a> setting is
            likely to be between 16 and 36, with the most common optimal
            values tending to be from 24 to 36. We have not seen any
            situation where the setting has been optimal beyond 36.
            There may be special cases where a value smaller than 16 is
            optimal.
          </p><p>
            For workloads such as DBT2 and Sysbench, the optimum for
            <a class="link" href="innodb-storage-engine.html" title="Chapter 15 The InnoDB Storage Engine"><code class="literal">InnoDB</code></a> seems to be usually
            around 36. For very write-intensive workloads, the optimal
            setting can sometimes be lower.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If the primary storage engine is
            <a class="link" href="myisam-storage-engine.html" title="16.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine"><code class="literal">MyISAM</code></a>, the
            <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_pool_size"><code class="literal">thread_pool_size</code></a> setting
            should be fairly low. Optimal performance is often seen with
            values from 4 to 8. Higher values tend to have a slightly
            negative but not dramatic impact on performance.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        Another system variable,
        <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit"><code class="literal">thread_pool_stall_limit</code></a>, is
        important for handling of blocked and long-running statements.
        If all calls that block the MySQL Server are reported to the
        thread pool, it would always know when execution threads are
        blocked. However, this may not always be true. For example,
        blocks could occur in code that has not been instrumented with
        thread pool callbacks. For such cases, the thread pool must be
        able to identify threads that appear to be blocked. This is done
        by means of a timeout that can be tuned using the
        <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit"><code class="literal">thread_pool_stall_limit</code></a> system
        variable, the value of which is measured in 10ms units. This
        parameter ensures that the server does not become completely
        blocked. The value of
        <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit"><code class="literal">thread_pool_stall_limit</code></a> has an
        upper limit of 6 seconds to prevent the risk of a deadlocked
        server.
      </p><p>
        <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit"><code class="literal">thread_pool_stall_limit</code></a> also
        enables the thread pool to handle long-running statements. If a
        long-running statement was permitted to block a thread group,
        all other connections assigned to the group would be blocked and
        unable to start execution until the long-running statement
        completed. In the worst case, this could take hours or even
        days.
      </p><p>
        The value of
        <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit"><code class="literal">thread_pool_stall_limit</code></a> should
        be chosen such that statements that execute longer than its
        value are considered stalled. Stalled statements generate a lot
        of extra overhead since they involve extra context switches and
        in some cases even extra thread creations. On the other hand,
        setting the
        <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit"><code class="literal">thread_pool_stall_limit</code></a>
        parameter too high means that long-running statements block a
        number of short-running statements for longer than necessary.
        Short wait values permit threads to start more quickly. Short
        values are also better for avoiding deadlock situations. Long
        wait values are useful for workloads that include long-running
        statements, to avoid starting too many new statements while the
        current ones execute.
      </p><p>
        Suppose a server executes a workload where 99.9% of the
        statements complete within 100ms even when the server is loaded,
        and the remaining statements take between 100ms and 2 hours
        fairly evenly spread. In this case, it would make sense to set
        <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit"><code class="literal">thread_pool_stall_limit</code></a> to 10
        (10 × 10ms = 100ms). The default value of 6 (60ms)
        is suitable for servers that primarily execute very simple
        statements.
      </p><p>
        The <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit"><code class="literal">thread_pool_stall_limit</code></a>
        parameter can be changed at runtime to enable you to strike a
        balance appropriate for the server work load. Assuming that the
        <a class="link" href="performance-schema-tp-thread-group-stats-table.html" title="27.12.16.2 The tp_thread_group_stats Table"><code class="literal">tp_thread_group_stats</code></a> table is
        enabled, you can use the following query to determine the
        fraction of executed statements that stalled:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">SELECT SUM(STALLED_QUERIES_EXECUTED) / SUM(QUERIES_EXECUTED)
FROM performance_schema.tp_thread_group_stats;
</pre><p>
        This number should be as low as possible. To decrease the
        likelihood of statements stalling, increase the value of
        <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit"><code class="literal">thread_pool_stall_limit</code></a>.
      </p><p>
        When a statement arrives, what is the maximum time it can be
        delayed before it actually starts executing? Suppose that the
        following conditions apply:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            There are 200 statements queued in the low-priority queue.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            There are 10 statements queued in the high-priority queue.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_pool_prio_kickup_timer"><code class="literal">thread_pool_prio_kickup_timer</code></a>
            is set to 10000 (10 seconds).
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit"><code class="literal">thread_pool_stall_limit</code></a> is
            set to 100 (1 second).
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        In the worst case, the 10 high-priority statements represent 10
        transactions that continue executing for a long time. Thus, in
        the worst case, no statements can be moved to the high-priority
        queue because it always already contains statements awaiting
        execution. After 10 seconds, the new statement is eligible to be
        moved to the high-priority queue. However, before it can be
        moved, all the statements before it must be moved as well. This
        could take another 2 seconds because a maximum of 100 statements
        per second are moved to the high-priority queue. Now when the
        statement reaches the high-priority queue, there could
        potentially be many long-running statements ahead of it. In the
        worst case, every one of those becomes stalled and 1 second is
        required for each statement before the next statement is
        retrieved from the high-priority queue. Thus, in this scenario,
        it takes 222 seconds before the new statement starts executing.
      </p><p>
        This example shows a worst case for an application. How to
        handle it depends on the application. If the application has
        high requirements for the response time, it should most likely
        throttle users at a higher level itself. Otherwise, it can use
        the thread pool configuration parameters to set some kind of a
        maximum waiting time.
