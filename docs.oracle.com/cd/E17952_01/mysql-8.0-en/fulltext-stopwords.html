        The stopword list is loaded and searched for full-text queries
        using the server character set and collation (the values of the
        <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_character_set_server"><code class="literal">character_set_server</code></a> and
        <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_collation_server"><code class="literal">collation_server</code></a> system
        variables). False hits or misses might occur for stopword
        lookups if the stopword file or columns used for full-text
        indexing or searches have a character set or collation different
        from <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_character_set_server"><code class="literal">character_set_server</code></a> or
        <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_collation_server"><code class="literal">collation_server</code></a>.
      </p><p>
        Case sensitivity of stopword lookups depends on the server
        collation. For example, lookups are case-insensitive if the
        collation is <code class="literal">utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci</code>, whereas
        lookups are case-sensitive if the collation is
        <code class="literal">utf8mb4_0900_as_cs</code> or
        <code class="literal">utf8mb4_bin</code>.

          <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> has a relatively short list of
          default stopwords, because documents from technical, literary,
          and other sources often use short words as keywords or in
          significant phrases. For example, you might search for
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">to be or not to be</span>”</span> and expect to get a sensible
          result, rather than having all those words ignored.

          The stopword file is loaded and searched using
          <code class="literal">latin1</code> if
          <code class="literal">character_set_server</code> is

          To override the default stopword list for MyISAM tables, set
          the <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_ft_stopword_file"><code class="literal">ft_stopword_file</code></a> system
          variable. (See <a class="xref" href="server-system-variables.html" title="5.1.8 Server System Variables">Section 5.1.8, “Server System Variables”</a>.) The
          variable value should be the path name of the file containing
          the stopword list, or the empty string to disable stopword
          filtering. The server looks for the file in the data directory
          unless an absolute path name is given to specify a different
          directory. After changing the value of this variable or the
          contents of the stopword file, restart the server and rebuild
          your <code class="literal">FULLTEXT</code> indexes.
        </p><p>
          The stopword list is free-form, separating stopwords with any
          nonalphanumeric character such as newline, space, or comma.
          Exceptions are the underscore character (<code class="literal">_</code>)
          and a single apostrophe (<code class="literal">'</code>) which are
          treated as part of a word. The character set of the stopword
          list is the server's default character set; see
          <a class="xref" href="charset-server.html" title="10.3.2 Server Character Set and Collation">Section 10.3.2, “Server Character Set and Collation”</a>.

          The following list shows the default stopwords for
