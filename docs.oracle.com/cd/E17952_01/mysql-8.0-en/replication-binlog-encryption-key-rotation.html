        When binary log encryption is enabled, you can rotate the binary
        log master key at any time while the server is running by
        issuing <a class="link" href="alter-instance.html#alter-instance-rotate-binlog-master-key"><code class="literal">ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER
        KEY</code></a>. When the binary log master key is rotated
        manually using this statement, the passwords for the new and
        subsequent files are encrypted using the new binary log master
        key, and also the file passwords for existing encrypted binary
        log files and relay log files are re-encrypted using the new
        binary log master key, so the encryption is renewed completely.
        You can rotate the binary log master key on a regular basis to
        comply with your organization's security policy, and also if you
        suspect that the current or any of the previous binary log
        master keys might have been compromised.
      </p><p>
        When you rotate the binary log master key manually, MySQL Server
        takes the following actions in sequence:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
            A new binary log encryption key is generated with the next
            available sequence number, stored on the keyring, and used
            as the new binary log master key.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The binary log and relay log files are rotated on all
            channels.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The new binary log master key is used to encrypt the file
            passwords for the new binary log and relay log files, and
            subsequent files until the key is changed again.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The file passwords for existing encrypted binary log files
            and relay log files on the server are re-encrypted in turn
            using the new binary log master key, starting with the most
            recent files. Any unencrypted files are skipped.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Binary log encryption keys that are no longer in use for any
            files after the re-encryption process are removed from the
            keyring.
          </p></li></ol></div><p>
        The <a class="link" href="privileges-provided.html#priv_binlog-encryption-admin"><code class="literal">BINLOG_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN</code></a>
        privilege is required to issue <a class="link" href="alter-instance.html#alter-instance-rotate-binlog-master-key"><code class="literal">ALTER
        INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY</code></a>, and the statement
        cannot be used if the
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_encryption"><code class="literal">binlog_encryption</code></a> system
        variable is set to <code class="literal">OFF</code>.
      </p><p>
        As the final step of the binary log master key rotation process,
        all binary log encryption keys that no longer apply to any
        retained binary log files or relay log files are cleaned up from
        the keyring. If a retained binary log file or relay log file
        cannot be initialized for re-encryption, the relevant binary log
        encryption keys are not deleted in case the files can be
        recovered in the future. For example, this might be the case if
        a file listed in a binary log index file is currently
        unreadable, or if a channel fails to initialize. If the server
        UUID changes, for example because a backup created using MySQL
        Enterprise Backup is used to set up a new replica, issuing
        <a class="link" href="alter-instance.html#alter-instance-rotate-binlog-master-key"><code class="literal">ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER
        KEY</code></a> on the new server does not delete any earlier
        binary log encryption keys that include the original server
        UUID.
      </p><p>
        If any of the first four steps of the binary log master key
        rotation process cannot be completed correctly, an error message
        is issued explaining the situation and the consequences for the
        encryption status of the binary log files and relay log files.
        Files that were previously encrypted are always left in an
        encrypted state, but their file passwords might still be
        encrypted using an old binary log master key. If you see these
        errors, first retry the process by issuing
        <a class="link" href="alter-instance.html#alter-instance-rotate-binlog-master-key"><code class="literal">ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER
        KEY</code></a> again. Then investigate the status of individual
        files to see what is blocking the process, especially if you
        suspect that the current or any of the previous binary log
        master keys might have been compromised.
      </p><p>
        If the final step of the binary log master key rotation process
        cannot be completed correctly, a warning message is issued
        explaining the situation. The warning message identifies whether
        the process could not clean up the auxiliary keys in the keyring
        for rotating the binary log master key, or could not clean up
        unused binary log encryption keys. You can choose to ignore the
        message as the keys are auxiliary keys or no longer in use, or
        you can issue <a class="link" href="alter-instance.html#alter-instance-rotate-binlog-master-key"><code class="literal">ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG
        MASTER KEY</code></a> again to retry the process.
      </p><p>
        If the server stops and is restarted with binary log encryption
        still set to <code class="literal">ON</code> during the binary log master
        key rotation process, new binary log files and relay log files
        after the restart are encrypted using the new binary log master
        key. However, the re-encryption of existing files is not
        continued, so files that did not get re-encrypted before the
        server stopped are left encrypted using the previous binary log
        master key. To complete re-encryption and clean up unused binary
        log encryption keys, issue <a class="link" href="alter-instance.html#alter-instance-rotate-binlog-master-key"><code class="literal">ALTER INSTANCE
        ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY</code></a> again after the restart.
      </p><p>
        <a class="link" href="alter-instance.html#alter-instance-rotate-binlog-master-key"><code class="literal">ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER
        KEY</code></a> actions are not written to the binary log and are
        not executed on replicas. Binary log master key rotation can
        therefore be carried out in replication environments including a
        mix of MySQL versions. To schedule regular rotation of the
        binary log master key on all applicable source and replica
        servers, you can enable the MySQL Event Scheduler on each server
        and issue the <a class="link" href="alter-instance.html#alter-instance-rotate-binlog-master-key"><code class="literal">ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG
        MASTER KEY</code></a> statement using a
        <a class="link" href="create-event.html" title="13.1.13 CREATE EVENT Statement"><code class="literal">CREATE EVENT</code></a> statement. If you
        rotate the binary log master key because you suspect that the
        current or any of the previous binary log master keys might have
        been compromised, issue the statement on every applicable source
        and replica server. Issuing the statement on individual servers
        ensures that you can verify immediate compliance, even in the
        case of replicas that are lagging, belong to multiple
        replication topologies, or are not currently active in the
        replication topology but have binary log and relay log files.
      </p><p>
        The
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_rotate_encryption_master_key_at_startup"><code class="literal">binlog_rotate_encryption_master_key_at_startup</code></a>
        system variable controls whether the binary log master key is
        automatically rotated when the server is restarted. If this
        system variable is set to <code class="literal">ON</code>, a new binary
        log encryption key is generated and used as the new binary log
        master key whenever the server is restarted. If it is set to
        <code class="literal">OFF</code>, which is the default, the existing
        binary log master key is used again after the restart. When the
        binary log master key is rotated at startup, the file passwords
        for the new binary log and relay log files are encrypted using
        the new key. The file passwords for the existing encrypted
        binary log files and relay log files are not re-encrypted, so
        they remain encrypted using the old key, which remains available
        on the keyring.
