    The buffer pool is an area in main memory where
    <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> caches table and index data as it is
    accessed. The buffer pool permits frequently used data to be
    accessed directly from memory, which speeds up processing. On
    dedicated servers, up to 80% of physical memory is often assigned to
    the buffer pool.
  </p><p>
    For efficiency of high-volume read operations, the buffer pool is
    divided into pages that can potentially hold multiple rows. For
    efficiency of cache management, the buffer pool is implemented as a
    linked list of pages; data that is rarely used is aged out of the
    cache using a variation of the least recently used (LRU) algorithm.
  </p><p>
    Knowing how to take advantage of the buffer pool to keep frequently
    accessed data in memory is an important aspect of MySQL tuning.
  </p><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="innodb-buffer-pool-lru"></a>Buffer Pool LRU Algorithm</h4></div></div></div><p>
      The buffer pool is managed as a list using a variation of the LRU
      algorithm. When room is needed to add a new page to the buffer
      pool, the least recently used page is evicted and a new page is
      added to the middle of the list. This midpoint insertion strategy
      treats the list as two sublists:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          At the head, a sublist of new (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">young</span>”</span>) pages
          that were accessed recently
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          At the tail, a sublist of old pages that were accessed less
          recently
        </p></li></ul></div><div class="figure"><a id="innodb-buffer-pool-list"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 15.2 Buffer Pool List</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/innodb-buffer-pool-list.png" width="376" height="603" alt="Content is described in the surrounding text." /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>
      The algorithm keeps frequently used pages in the new sublist. The
      old sublist contains less frequently used pages; these pages are
      candidates for <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_eviction" title="eviction">eviction</a>.
    </p><p>
      By default, the algorithm operates as follows:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          3/8 of the buffer pool is devoted to the old sublist.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          The midpoint of the list is the boundary where the tail of the
          new sublist meets the head of the old sublist.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          When <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> reads a page into the buffer
          pool, it initially inserts it at the midpoint (the head of the
          old sublist). A page can be read because it is required for a
          user-initiated operation such as an SQL query, or as part of a
          <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_read_ahead" title="read-ahead">read-ahead</a> operation
          performed automatically by <code class="literal">InnoDB</code>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Accessing a page in the old sublist makes it
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">young</span>”</span>, moving it to the head of the new
          sublist. If the page was read because it was required by a
          user-initiated operation, the first access occurs immediately
          and the page is made young. If the page was read due to a
          read-ahead operation, the first access does not occur
          immediately and might not occur at all before the page is
          evicted.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          As the database operates, pages in the buffer pool that are
          not accessed <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">age</span>”</span> by moving toward the tail of
          the list. Pages in both the new and old sublists age as other
          pages are made new. Pages in the old sublist also age as pages
          are inserted at the midpoint. Eventually, a page that remains
          unused reaches the tail of the old sublist and is evicted.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      By default, pages read by queries are immediately moved into the
      new sublist, meaning they stay in the buffer pool longer. A table
      scan, performed for a <a class="link" href="mysqldump.html" title="4.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"><span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span></a> operation or a
      <code class="literal">SELECT</code> statement with no
      <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause, for example, can bring a large
      amount of data into the buffer pool and evict an equivalent amount
      of older data, even if the new data is never used again.
      Similarly, pages that are loaded by the read-ahead background
      thread and accessed only once are moved to the head of the new
      list. These situations can push frequently used pages to the old
      sublist where they become subject to eviction. For information
      about optimizing this behavior, see
      <a class="xref" href="innodb-performance-midpoint_insertion.html" title="15.8.3.3 Making the Buffer Pool Scan Resistant">Section 15.8.3.3, “Making the Buffer Pool Scan Resistant”</a>, and

          Ideally, you set the size of the buffer pool to as large a
          value as practical, leaving enough memory for other processes
          on the server to run without excessive paging. The larger the
          buffer pool, the more <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> acts like an
          in-memory database, reading data from disk once and then
          accessing the data from memory during subsequent reads. See

          On 64-bit systems with sufficient memory, you can split the

          The <code class="literal">youngs/s</code> metric is applicable only to
          old pages. It is based on the number of page accesses. There
          can be multiple accesses for a given page, all of which are
          counted. If you see very low <code class="literal">youngs/s</code>
          values when there are no large scans occurring, consider
          reducing the delay time or increasing the percentage of the
