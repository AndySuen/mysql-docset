        show status information for the replica's coordinator thread and
        applier worker threads respectively. For a replica with multiple
        channels, the threads for each channel are identified.
      </p><p>
        A multithreaded replica's coordinator thread also prints
        statistics to the replica's error log on a regular basis if the
        verbosity setting is set to display informational messages. The
        statistics are printed depending on the volume of events that
        the coordinator thread has assigned to applier worker threads,
        with a maximum frequency of once every 120 seconds. The message
        lists the following statistics for the relevant replication
        channel, or the default replication channel (which is not
        named):

              unusually large event exceeds this size, the transaction
              is held until all the applier worker threads have empty
              queues, and then processed. All subsequent transactions
              are held until the large transaction has been completed.

              filled beyond the underrun level of 10% of the maximum
              queue length, in which case it sleeps for a maximum of 1

              coordinator thread needs to assign the first event of a
              transaction to an applier worker thread's queue, it only
              does this to a worker with an empty queue, so if no queues
              are empty, the coordinator thread sleeps until one becomes
              empty.
