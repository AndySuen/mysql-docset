      When you upgrade servers that participate in a replication
      topology, you need to take into account each server&#39;s role in the
      topology and look out for issues specific to replication. For
      general information and instructions for upgrading a MySQL Server
      instance, see <a class="xref" href="upgrading.html" title="2.10&nbsp;Upgrading MySQL">Section&nbsp;2.10, &ldquo;Upgrading MySQL&rdquo;</a>.
    </p><p>
      As explained in
      <a class="xref" href="replication-compatibility.html" title="17.5.2&nbsp;Replication Compatibility Between MySQL Versions">Section&nbsp;17.5.2, &ldquo;Replication Compatibility Between MySQL Versions&rdquo;</a>, MySQL supports
      replication from a source running one release series to a replica
      running the next higher release series, but does not support
      replication from a source running a later release to a replica
      running an earlier release. A replica at an earlier release might
      not have the required capability to process transactions that can
      be handled by the source at a later release. You must therefore
      upgrade all of the replicas in a replication topology to the
      target MySQL Server release, before you upgrade the source server
      to the target release. In this way you will never be in the
      situation where a replica still at the earlier release is
      attempting to handle transactions from a source at the later
      release.
    </p><p>
      In a replication topology where there are multiple sources
      (multi-source replication), the use of more than two MySQL Server
      versions is not supported, regardless of the number of source or
      replica MySQL servers. This restriction applies not only to
      release series, but to version numbers within the same release
      series as well. For example, you cannot use MySQL
      8.0.22, MySQL 8.0.24, and MySQL
      8.0.28 concurrently in such a setup, although you
      could use any two of these releases together.
    </p><p>
      If you need to downgrade the servers in a replication topology,
      the source must be downgraded before the replicas are downgraded.
      On the replicas, you must ensure that the binary log and relay log
      have been fully processed, and remove them before proceeding with
      the downgrade.
    </p><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><a class="dashingAutolink" name="autolink-3801"></a><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Behavior%20Changes%20Between%20Releases"></a><h4 class="title"><a id="idm45828855788464"></a>Behavior Changes Between Releases</h4></div></div></div><p>
        Although this upgrade sequence is correct, it is possible to
        still encounter replication difficulties when replicating from a
        source at an earlier release that has not yet been upgraded, to
        a replica at a later release that has been upgraded. This can
        happen if the source uses statements or relies on behavior that
        is no longer supported in the later release installed on the
        replica. You can use MySQL Shell&#39;s upgrade checker utility
        <code class="literal">util.checkForServerUpgrade()</code> to check MySQL
        5.7 server instances or MySQL 8.0 server instances for upgrade
        to a GA MySQL 8.0 release. The utility identifies anything that
        needs to be fixed for that server instance so that it does not
        cause an issue after the upgrade, including features and
        behaviors that are no longer available in the later release. See
        <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-shell-8.0-en/mysql-shell-utilities-upgrade.html" target="_top">Upgrade Checker Utility</a> for
        information on the upgrade checker utility.
      </p><p>
        If you are upgrading an existing replication setup from a
        version of MySQL that does not support global transaction
        identifiers (GTIDs) to a version that does, only enable GTIDs on
        the source and the replicas when you have made sure that the
        setup meets all the requirements for GTID-based replication. See
        <a class="xref" href="replication-gtids-howto.html" title="17.1.3.4&nbsp;Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs">Section&nbsp;17.1.3.4, &ldquo;Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs&rdquo;</a> for information about
        converting binary log file position based replication setups to
        use GTID-based replication.

        Changes affecting operations in strict SQL mode
        (<a class="link" href="sql-mode.html#sqlmode_strict_trans_tables"><code class="literal">STRICT_TRANS_TABLES</code></a> or
        <a class="link" href="sql-mode.html#sqlmode_strict_all_tables"><code class="literal">STRICT_ALL_TABLES</code></a>) may result
        in replication failure on an upgraded replica. If you use
        statement-based logging
        (<a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format=STATEMENT</code></a>),
        if a replica is upgraded before the source, the source executes
        statements which succeed there but which may fail on the replica
        and so cause replication to stop. To deal with this, stop all
        new statements on the source and wait until the replicas catch
        up, then upgrade the replicas. Alternatively, if you cannot stop
        new statements, temporarily change to row-based logging on the
        source
        (<a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format=ROW</code></a>)
        and wait until all replicas have processed all binary logs
        produced up to the point of this change, then upgrade the
        replicas.
      </p><p>
        The default character set has changed from
        <code class="literal">latin1</code> to <code class="literal">utf8mb4</code> in MySQL
        8.0. In a replicated setting, when upgrading from MySQL 5.7 to
        8.0, it is advisable to change the default character set back to
        the character set used in MySQL 5.7 before upgrading. After the
        upgrade is completed, the default character set can be changed
        to <code class="literal">utf8mb4</code>. Assuming that the previous
        defaults were used, one way to preserve them is to start the
        server with these lines in the <code class="filename">my.cnf</code> file:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">[mysqld]

        Some upgrades may require that you drop and re-create database
        objects when you move from one MySQL series to the next. For
        example, collation changes might require that table indexes be
        rebuilt. Such operations, if necessary, are detailed at
        <a class="xref" href="upgrading-from-previous-series.html" title="2.10.4&nbsp;Changes in MySQL 8.0">Section&nbsp;2.10.4, &ldquo;Changes in MySQL 8.0&rdquo;</a>. It is
        safest to perform these operations separately on the replicas
        and the source, and to disable replication of these operations
        from the source to the replica. To achieve this, use the
        following procedure:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
            Stop all the replicas and upgrade the binaries or packages.
            Restart them with the
            <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start"><code class="option">--skip-slave-start</code></a> option, or
            from MySQL 8.0.24, the
            <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_skip_slave_start"><code class="literal">skip_slave_start</code></a>
            system variable, so that they do not connect to the source.
            Perform any table repair or rebuilding operations needed to
            re-create database objects, such as use of <code class="literal">REPAIR
            TABLE</code> or <code class="literal">ALTER TABLE</code>, or
            dumping and reloading tables or triggers.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Disable the binary log on the source. To do this without
            restarting the source, execute a <code class="literal">SET sql_log_bin =
            OFF</code> statement. Alternatively, stop the source and
            restart it with the
            <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#option_mysqld_log-bin"><code class="option">--skip-log-bin</code></a>
            option. If you restart the source, you might also want to
            disallow client connections. For example, if all clients
            connect using TCP/IP, enable the
            <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_skip_networking"><code class="literal">skip_networking</code></a>
            system variable when you restart the source.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            With the binary log disabled, perform any table repair or
            rebuilding operations needed to re-create database objects.
            The binary log must be disabled during this step to prevent
            these operations from being logged and sent to the replicas
            later.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Re-enable the binary log on the source. If you set
            <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_sql_log_bin"><code class="literal">sql_log_bin</code></a> to
            <code class="literal">OFF</code> earlier, execute a <code class="literal">SET
            sql_log_bin = ON</code> statement. If you restarted the
            source to disable the binary log, restart it without
            <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#option_mysqld_log-bin"><code class="option">--skip-log-bin</code></a>,
            and without enabling the
            <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_skip_networking"><code class="literal">skip_networking</code></a> system
            variable so that clients and replicas can connect.
