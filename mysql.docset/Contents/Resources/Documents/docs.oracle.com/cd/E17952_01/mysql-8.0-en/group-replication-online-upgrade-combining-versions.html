      Group Replication is versioned according to the MySQL Server
      version that the Group Replication plugin was bundled with. For
      example, if a member is running MySQL 5.7.26 then that is the
      version of the Group Replication plugin. To check the version of
      MySQL Server on a group member issue:
    </p><pre class="programlisting"><strong class="userinput"><code>SELECT MEMBER_HOST,MEMBER_PORT,MEMBER_VERSION FROM performance_schema.replication_group_members;</code></strong>
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| member_host | member_port | member_version |
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| example.com |	   3306     |   8.0.13	     |
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
      </pre><p>
      For guidance on understanding the MySQL Server version and
      selecting a version, see <a class="xref" href="which-version.html" title="2.1.2&nbsp;Which MySQL Version and Distribution to Install">Section&nbsp;2.1.2, &ldquo;Which MySQL Version and Distribution to Install&rdquo;</a>.
    </p><p>
      For optimal compatibility and performance, all members of a group
      should run the same version of MySQL Server and therefore of Group
      Replication. However, while you are in the process of upgrading an
      online group, in order to maximize availability, you might need to
      have members with different MySQL Server versions running at the
      same time. Depending on the changes made between the versions of
      MySQL, you could encounter incompatibilities in this situation.
      For example, if a feature has been deprecated between major
      versions, then combining the versions in a group might cause
      members that rely on the deprecated feature to fail. Conversely,
      writing to a member running a newer MySQL version while there are
      read-write members in the group running an older MySQL version
      might cause issues on members that lack functions introduced in
      the newer release.
    </p><p>
      To prevent these issues, Group Replication includes compatibility
      policies that enable you to safely combine members running
      different versions of MySQL in the same group. A member applies
      these policies to decide whether to join the group normally, or
      join in read-only mode, or not join the group, depending on which
      choice results in the safe operation of the joining member and of
      the existing members of the group. In an upgrade scenario, each
      server must leave the group, be upgraded, and rejoin the group
      with its new server version. At this point the member applies the
      policies for its new server version, which might have changed from
      the policies it applied when it originally joined the group.
    </p><p>
      As the administrator, you can instruct any server to attempt to
      join any group by configuring the server appropriately and issuing
      a <a class="link" href="start-group-replication.html" title="13.4.3.1&nbsp;START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement"><code class="literal">START GROUP_REPLICATION</code></a>
      statement. A decision to join or not join the group, or to join
      the group in read-only mode, is made and implemented by the
      joining member itself after you attempt to add it to the group.
      The joining member receives information on the MySQL Server
      versions of the current group members, assesses its own
      compatibility with those members, and applies the policies used in
      its own MySQL Server version (<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the
      policies used by the existing members) to decide whether it is
      compatible.
    </p><p>
      The compatibility policies that a joining member applies when
      attempting to join a group are as follows:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          A member does not join a group if it is running a lower MySQL
          Server version than the lowest version that the existing group
          members are running.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          A member joins a group normally if it is running the same
          MySQL Server version as the lowest version that the existing
          group members are running.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          A member joins a group but remains in read-only mode if it is
          running a higher MySQL Server version than the lowest version
          that the existing group members are running. This behavior
          only makes a difference when the group is running in
          multi-primary mode, because in a group that is running in
          single-primary mode, newly added members default to being
          read-only in any case.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Members running MySQL 8.0.17 or higher take into account the patch
      version of the release when checking their compatibility. Members
      running MySQL 8.0.16 or lower, or MySQL 5.7, only take into
      account the major version. For example, if you have a group with
      members all running MySQL version 8.0.13:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          A member that is running MySQL version 5.7 does not join.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          A member running MySQL 8.0.16 joins normally (because it
          considers the major version).
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          A member running MySQL 8.0.17 joins but remains in read-only
          mode (because it considers the patch version).
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Note that joining members running releases before MySQL 5.7.27
      check against all group members to find whether their own MySQL
      Server major version is lower. They therefore fail this check for
      a group where any members are running MySQL 8.0 releases, and
      cannot join the group even if it already has other members running
      MySQL 5.7. From MySQL 5.7.27, joining members only check against
      the group members that are running the lowest major version, so
      they can join a mixed version group where other MySQL 5.7 servers
      are present.
    </p><p>
      In a multi-primary mode group with members that use different
      MySQL Server versions, Group Replication automatically manages the
      read-write and read-only status of members running MySQL 8.0.17 or
      higher. If a member leaves the group, the members running the
      version that is now the lowest are automatically set to read-write
      mode. When you change a group that was running in single-primary
      mode to run in multi-primary mode, using the
      <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-mode.html#function_group-replication-switch-to-multi-primary-mode"><code class="literal">group_replication_switch_to_multi_primary_mode()</code></a>
      function, Group Replication automatically sets members to the
      correct mode. Members are automatically placed in read-only mode
      if they are running a higher MySQL server version than the lowest
      version present in the group, and members running the lowest
      version are placed in read-write mode.
