      GTIDs replace the file-offset pairs previously required to
      determine points for starting, stopping, or resuming the flow of
      data between source and replica. When GTIDs are in use, all the
      information that the replica needs for synchronizing with the
      source is obtained directly from the replication data stream.
    </p><p>
      To start a replica using GTID-based replication, you need to
      enable the <code class="literal">SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION</code> |
      <code class="literal">MASTER_AUTO_POSITION</code> option in the
      <a class="link" href="change-replication-source-to.html" title="13.4.2.3&nbsp;CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement"><code class="literal">CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO</code></a>
      statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or <a class="link" href="change-master-to.html" title="13.4.2.1&nbsp;CHANGE MASTER TO Statement"><code class="literal">CHANGE
      MASTER TO</code></a> statement (before MySQL 8.0.23). The
      alternative <code class="literal">SOURCE_LOG_FILE</code> |
      <code class="literal">MASTER_LOG_FILE</code> and
      <code class="literal">SOURCE_LOG_POS</code> |
      <code class="literal">MASTER_LOG_POS</code> options specify the name of the
      log file and the starting position within the file, but with GTIDs
      the replica does not need this nonlocal data.. For full
      instructions to configure and start sources and replicas using
      GTID-based replication, see
      <a class="xref" href="replication-gtids-howto.html" title="17.1.3.4&nbsp;Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs">Section&nbsp;17.1.3.4, &ldquo;Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs&rdquo;</a>.
    </p><p>
      The <code class="literal">SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION</code> |
      <code class="literal">MASTER_AUTO_POSITION</code> option is disabled by
      default. If multi-source replication is enabled on the replica,
      you need to set the option for each applicable replication
      channel. Disabling the <code class="literal">SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION</code> |
      <code class="literal">MASTER_AUTO_POSITION</code> option again makes the
      replica revert to file-based replication, in which case you must
      also specify one or both of the <code class="literal">SOURCE_LOG_FILE</code>
      | <code class="literal">MASTER_LOG_FILE</code> or
      <code class="literal">SOURCE_LOG_POS</code> |
      <code class="literal">MASTER_LOG_POS</code> options.
    </p><p>
      When a replica has GTIDs enabled
      (<a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_mode"><code class="literal">GTID_MODE=ON</code></a>,
      <code class="literal">ON_PERMISSIVE,</code> or
      <code class="literal">OFF_PERMISSIVE</code> ) and the
      <code class="literal">MASTER_AUTO_POSITION</code> option enabled,
      auto-positioning is activated for connection to the source. The
      source must have <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_mode"><code class="literal">GTID_MODE=ON</code></a> set
      in order for the connection to succeed. In the initial handshake,
      the replica sends a GTID set containing the transactions that it
      has already received, committed, or both. This GTID set is equal
      to the union of the set of GTIDs in the
      <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> system variable
      (<code class="literal">@@GLOBAL.gtid_executed</code>), and the set of GTIDs
      recorded in the Performance Schema
      <a class="link" href="performance-schema-replication-connection-status-table.html" title="27.12.11.2&nbsp;The replication_connection_status Table"><code class="literal">replication_connection_status</code></a> table
      as received transactions (the result of the statement
      <code class="literal">SELECT RECEIVED_TRANSACTION_SET FROM
      PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.replication_connection_status</code>).
    </p><p>
      The source responds by sending all transactions recorded in its
      binary log whose GTID is not included in the GTID set sent by the
      replica. To do this, the source first identifies the appropriate
      binary log file to begin working with, by checking the
      <code class="literal">Previous_gtids_log_event</code> in the header of each
      of its binary log files, starting with the most recent. When the
      source finds the first <code class="literal">Previous_gtids_log_event</code>
      which contains no transactions that the replica is missing, it
      begins with that binary log file. This method is efficient and
      only takes a significant amount of time if the replica is behind
      the source by a large number of binary log files. The source then
      reads the transactions in that binary log file and subsequent
      files up to the current one, sending the transactions with GTIDs
      that the replica is missing, and skipping the transactions that
      were in the GTID set sent by the replica. The elapsed time until
      the replica receives the first missing transaction depends on its
      offset in the binary log file. This exchange ensures that the
      source only sends the transactions with a GTID that the replica
      has not already received or committed. If the replica receives
      transactions from more than one source, as in the case of a
      diamond topology, the auto-skip function ensures that the
      transactions are not applied twice.
    </p><p>
      If any of the transactions that should be sent by the source have
      been purged from the source&#39;s binary log, or added to the set of
      GTIDs in the <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_purged"><code class="literal">gtid_purged</code></a> system
      variable by another method, the source sends the error
      <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-errors-8.0-en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_master_has_purged_required_gtids" target="_top"><code class="literal">ER_MASTER_HAS_PURGED_REQUIRED_GTIDS</code></a>
      to the replica, and replication does not start. The GTIDs of the
      missing purged transactions are identified and listed in the
      source&#39;s error log in the warning message
      <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-errors-8.0-en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_found_missing_gtids" target="_top"><code class="literal">ER_FOUND_MISSING_GTIDS</code></a>. The
      replica cannot recover automatically from this error because parts
      of the transaction history that are needed to catch up with the
      source have been purged. Attempting to reconnect without the
      <code class="literal">MASTER_AUTO_POSITION</code> option enabled only
      results in the loss of the purged transactions on the replica. The
      correct approach to recover from this situation is for the replica
      to replicate the missing transactions listed in the
      <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-errors-8.0-en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_found_missing_gtids" target="_top"><code class="literal">ER_FOUND_MISSING_GTIDS</code></a> message
      from another source, or for the replica to be replaced by a new
      replica created from a more recent backup. Consider revising the
      binary log expiration period
      (<a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds"><code class="literal">binlog_expire_logs_seconds</code></a>) on
      the source to ensure that the situation does not occur again.
    </p><p>
      If during the exchange of transactions it is found that the
      replica has received or committed transactions with the source&#39;s
      UUID in the GTID, but the source itself does not have a record of
      them, the source sends the error
      <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-errors-8.0-en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_slave_has_more_gtids_than_master" target="_top"><code class="literal">ER_SLAVE_HAS_MORE_GTIDS_THAN_MASTER</code></a>
      to the replica and replication does not start. This situation can
      occur if a source that does not have
      <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_sync_binlog"><code class="literal">sync_binlog=1</code></a> set experiences a
      power failure or operating system crash, and loses committed
      transactions that have not yet been synchronized to the binary log
      file, but have been received by the replica. The source and
      replica can diverge if any clients commit transactions on the
      source after it is restarted, which can lead to the situation
      where the source and replica are using the same GTID for different
      transactions. The correct approach to recover from this situation
      is to check manually whether the source and replica have diverged.
      If the same GTID is now in use for different transactions, you
      either need to perform manual conflict resolution for individual
      transactions as required, or remove either the source or the
      replica from the replication topology. If the issue is only
      missing transactions on the source, you can make the source into a
      replica instead, allow it to catch up with the other servers in
      the replication topology, and then make it a source again if
      needed.
    </p><p>
      For a multi-source replica in a diamond topology (where the
      replica replicates from two or more sources, which in turn
      replicate from a common source), when GTID-based replication is in
      use, ensure that any replication filters or other channel
      configuration are identical on all channels on the multi-source
      replica. With GTID-based replication, filters are applied only to
      the transaction data, and GTIDs are not filtered out. This happens
      so that a replica&rsquo;s GTID set stays consistent with the
      source&rsquo;s, meaning GTID auto-positioning can be used without
      re-acquiring filtered out transactions each time. In the case
      where the downstream replica is multi-source and receives the same
      transaction from multiple sources in a diamond topology, the
      downstream replica now has multiple versions of the transaction,
      and the result depends on which channel applies the transaction
      first. The second channel to attempt it skips the transaction
      using GTID auto-skip, because the transaction&rsquo;s GTID was added
      to the <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> set by the
      first channel. With identical filtering on the channels, there is
      no problem because all versions of the transaction contain the
      same data, so the results are the same. However, with different
      filtering on the channels, the database can become inconsistent
      and replication can hang.
