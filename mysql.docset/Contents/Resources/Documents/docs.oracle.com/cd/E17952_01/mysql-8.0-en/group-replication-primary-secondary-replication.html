        Traditional MySQL <a class="link" href="replication.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;17&nbsp;Replication">Replication</a>
        provides a simple source to replica approach to replication. The
        source is the primary, and there are one or more replicas, which
        are secondaries. The source applies transactions, commits them
        and then they are later (thus asynchronously) sent to the
        replicas to be either re-executed (in statement-based
        replication) or applied (in row-based replication). It is a
        shared-nothing system, where all servers have a full copy of the
        data by default.

        There is also semisynchronous replication, which adds one
        synchronization step to the protocol. This means that the
        primary waits, at apply time, for the secondary to acknowledge
        that it has <span class="emphasis"><em>received</em></span> the transaction. Only
        then does the primary resume the commit operation.

        In the two pictures there is a diagram of the classic
        asynchronous MySQL Replication protocol (and its semisynchronous
        variant as well). The arrows between the different instances
        represent messages exchanged between servers or messages
        exchanged between servers and the client application.
