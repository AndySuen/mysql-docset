    This is the Reference Manual for the MySQL Database System, version
    8.0, through release 8.0.33. Differences
    between minor versions of MySQL 8.0 are noted in the
    present text with reference to release numbers
    (8.0.<em class="replaceable"><code>x</code></em>). For license
    information, see the <a class="link" href="preface.html#legalnotice" title="Legal Notices">Legal
    Notices</a>.
  </p><p>
    This manual is not intended for use with older versions of the MySQL
    software due to the many functional and other differences between
    MySQL 8.0 and previous versions. If you are using an
    earlier release of the MySQL software, please refer to the
    appropriate manual. For example,
    <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-5.7-en/" target="_top"><em class="citetitle">MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual</em></a>
