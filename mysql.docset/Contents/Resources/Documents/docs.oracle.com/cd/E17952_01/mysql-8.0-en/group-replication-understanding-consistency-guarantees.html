        In terms of distributed consistency guarantees, either in normal
        or failure repair operations, Group Replication has always been
        an eventual consistency system. This means that as soon as the
        incoming traffic slows down or stops, all group members have the
        same data content. The events that relate to the consistency of
        a system can be split into control operations, either manual or
        automatically triggered by failures; and data flow operations.
      </p><p>
        For Group Replication, the control operations that can be
        evaluated in terms of consistency are:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            a member joining or leaving, which is covered by Group

            write protection.

            network failures, which are covered by the fencing modes.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            in single-primary groups, primary failover, which can also
            be an operation triggered by
            <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-new-primary.html#function_group-replication-set-as-primary"><code class="literal">group_replication_set_as_primary()</code></a>.
          </p></li></ul></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="group-replication-control-operation-failover"></a>Consistency Guarantees and Primary Failover</h5></div></div></div><a id="idm45828854318368" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idm45828854316880" class="indexterm"></a><p>
          

          In a single-primary group, in the event of a primary failover
          when a secondary is promoted to primary, the new primary can
          either be made available to application traffic immediately,
          regardless of how large the replication backlog is, or
          alternatively access to it can be restricted until the backlog
          has been applied.
        </p><p>
          With the first approach, the group takes the minimum time
          possible to secure a stable group membership after a primary
          failure by electing a new primary and then allowing data
          access immediately while it is still applying any possible
          backlog from the old primary. Write consistency is ensured,
          but reads can temporarily retrieve stale data while the new
          primary applies the backlog. For example, if client C1 wrote
          <code class="literal">A=2 WHERE A=1</code> on the old primary just
          before its failure, when client C1 is reconnected to the new
          primary it could potentially read <code class="literal">A=1</code> until
          the new primary applies its backlog and catches up with the
          state of the old primary before it left the group.
        </p><p>
          With the second alternative, the system secures a stable group
          membership after the primary failure and elects a new primary
          in the same way as the first alternative, but in this case the
          group then waits until the new primary applies all backlog and
          only then does it permit data access. This ensures that in a
          situation as described previously, when client C1 is
          reconnected to the new primary it reads
          <code class="literal">A=2</code>. However, the trade-off is that the
          time required to failover is then proportional to the size of
          the backlog, which on a correctly configured group should be
          small

          

          .
        </p><p>
          Prior to MySQL 8.0.14 there was no way to configure the
          failover policy, by default availability was maximized as
          described in the first approach. In a group with members
          running MySQL 8.0.14 and higher, you can configure the level
          of transaction consistency guarantees provided by members
          during primary failover using the
          <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_consistency"><code class="literal">group_replication_consistency</code></a>
          variable. See
          <a class="xref" href="group-replication-configuring-consistency-guarantees.html#group-replication-consistency-level-impact-election" title="Impact of Consistency on Primary Election">Impact of Consistency on Primary Election</a>.
        </p></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="group-replication-data-flow-operations"></a>Data Flow Operations</h5></div></div></div><a id="idm45828854304304" class="indexterm"></a><p>
          Data flow is relevant to group consistency guarantees due to
          the reads and writes executed against a group, especially when
          these operations are distributed across all members. Data flow
          operations apply to both modes of Group Replication:
          single-primary and multi-primary, however to make this
          explanation clearer it is restricted to single-primary mode.
          The usual way to split incoming read or write transactions
          across a single-primary group&#39;s members is to route writes to
          the primary and evenly distribute reads to the secondaries.
          Since the group should behave as a single entity, it is
          reasonable to expect that writes on the primary are
          instantaneously available on the secondaries. Although Group
          Replication is written using Group Communication System (GCS)
          protocols that implement the Paxos algorithm, some parts of
          Group Replication are asynchronous, which implies that data is
          asynchronously applied to secondaries. This means that a
          client C2 can write <code class="literal">B=2 WHERE B=1</code> on the
          primary, immediately connect to a secondary and read
          <code class="literal">B=1</code>. This is because the secondary is still
          applying backlog, and has not applied the transaction which
          was applied by the primary.
        </p></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="group-replication-synchronization-points"></a>Transaction Synchronization Points</h5></div></div></div><a id="idm45828854298224" class="indexterm"></a><p>
          You configure a group&#39;s consistency guarantee based on the
          point at which you want to synchronize transactions across the
          group. To help you understand the concept, this section
          simplifies the points of synchronizing transactions across a
          group to be at the time of a read operation or at the time of
          a write operation. If data is synchronized at the time of a
          read, the current client session waits until a given
          point,&nbsp;which is the point in time that all preceding update
          transactions have been applied, before it can start executing.
          With this approach, only this session is affected, all other
          concurrent data operations are not affected.
        </p><p>
          If data is synchronized at the time of write, the writing
          session waits until all secondaries have written their data.
          Group Replication uses a total order on writes, and therefore
          this implies waiting for this and all preceding writes that
          are in secondaries&rsquo; queues to be applied. Therefore when
          using this synchronization point, the writing session waits
          for all secondaries queues to be applied.
        </p><p>
          Any alternative ensures that in the situation described for
          client C2 would always read <code class="literal">B=2</code> even if
          immediately connected to a secondary. Each alternative has its
          advantages and disadvantages, which are directly related to
          your system workload. The following examples describe
          different types of workloads and advise which point of
          synchronization is appropriate.
        </p><p>
          Imagine the following situations:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              you want to load balance your reads without deploying
              additional restrictions on which server you read from to
              avoid reading stale data, group writes are much less
              common than group reads.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              you have a group that has a predominantly read-only data,
              you want read-write transactions to be applied everywhere
              once they commit, so that subsequent reads are done on
              up-to-date data that includes the latest write. This
              ensures that you do not pay the synchronization cost for
              every RO transaction, but only on RW ones.
            </p></li></ul></div><p>
          In these cases, you should choose to synchronize on writes.

              You want specific transactions in your workload to always

              or similar data) and you want to enforce that reads
              retrieve the most up to date value.
            </p></li></ul></div><p>
          In these cases, you should choose to synchronize on reads.
