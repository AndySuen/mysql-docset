      Group Replication&#39;s failure detection mechanism is designed to
      identify group members that are no longer communicating with the
      group, and expel them as and when it seems likely that they have
      failed. Having a failure detection mechanism increases the chance
      that the group contains a majority of correctly working members,
      and that requests from clients are therefore processed correctly.
    </p><p>
      Normally, all group members regularly exchange messages with all
      other group members. If a group member does not receive any
      messages from a particular fellow member for 5 seconds, when this
      detection period ends, it creates a suspicion of the fellow
      member. When a suspicion times out, the suspected member is
      assumed to have failed, and is expelled from the group. An
      expelled member is removed from the membership list seen by the
      other members, but it does not know that it has been expelled from
      the group, so it sees itself as online and the other members as
      unreachable. If the member has not in fact failed (for example,
      because it was just disconnected due to a temporary network issue)
      and it is able to resume communication with the other members, it
      receives a view containing the information that it has been
      expelled from the group.
    </p><p>
      The responses of group members, including the failed member
      itself, to these situations can be configured at a number of
      points in the process. By default, the following behaviors happen
      if a member is suspected of having failed:
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
          Up to MySQL 8.0.20, when a suspicion is created, it times out
          immediately. The suspected member is liable for expulsion as
          soon as the expired suspicion is identified by the group. The
          member could potentially survive for a further few seconds
          after the timeout because the check for expired suspicions is
          carried out periodically. From MySQL 8.0.21, a waiting period
          of 5 seconds is added before the suspicion times out and the
          suspected member is liable for expulsion.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If an expelled member resumes communication and realises that
          it was expelled, up to MySQL 8.0.20, it does not try to rejoin
          the group. From MySQL 8.0.21, it makes three automatic
          attempts to rejoin the group (with 5 minutes between each
          attempt), and if this auto-rejoin procedure does not work, it
          then stops trying to rejoin the group.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          When an expelled member is not trying to rejoin the group, it
          switches to super read only mode and awaits operator
          attention. (The exception is in releases from MySQL 8.0.12 to
          8.0.15, where the default was for the member to shut itself
          down. From MySQL 8.0.16, the behavior was changed to match the
          behavior in MySQL 5.7.)
        </p></li></ol></div><p>
      You can use the Group Replication configuration options described
      in this section to change these behaviors either permanently or
      temporarily, to suit your system&#39;s requirements and your
      priorities. If you are experiencing unnecessary expulsions caused
      by slower networks or machines, networks with a high rate of
      unexpected transient outages, or planned network outages, consider
      increasing the expel timeout and auto-rejoin attempts. From MySQL
      8.0.21, the default settings have been changed in this direction
      to reduce the frequency of the need for operator intervention to
      reinstate expelled members in these situations. Note that while a
      member is undergoing any of the default behaviors described above,
      although it does not accept writes, reads can still be made if the
      member is still communicating with clients, with an increasing
      likelihood of stale reads over time. If avoiding stale reads is a
      higher priority for you than avoiding operator intervention,
      consider reducing the expel timeout and auto-rejoin attempts or
      setting them to zero.
    </p><p>
      Members that have not failed might lose contact with part, but not
      all, of the replication group due to a network partition. For
      example, in a group of 5 servers (S1,S2,S3,S4,S5), if there is a
      disconnection between (S1,S2) and (S3,S4,S5) there is a network
      partition. The first group (S1,S2) is now in a minority because it
      cannot contact more than half of the group. Any transactions that
      are processed by the members in the minority group are blocked,
      because the majority of the group is unreachable, therefore the
      group cannot achieve quorum. For a detailed description of this
      scenario, see
      <a class="xref" href="group-replication-network-partitioning.html" title="18.7.8&nbsp;Handling a Network Partition and Loss of Quorum">Section&nbsp;18.7.8, &ldquo;Handling a Network Partition and Loss of Quorum&rdquo;</a>.
      In this situation, the default behavior is for the members in both
      the minority and the majority to remain in the group, continue to
      accept transactions (although they are blocked on the members in
      the minority), and wait for operator intervention. This behavior
      is also configurable.
    </p><p>
      Note that where group members are at an older MySQL Server release
      that does not support a relevant setting, or at a release with a
      different default, they act towards themselves and other group
      members according to the default behaviors stated above. For
      example, a member that does not support the
      <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout"><code class="literal">group_replication_member_expel_timeout</code></a>
      system variable expels other members as soon as an expired
      suspicion is detected, and this expulsion is accepted by other
      members even if they support the system variable and have a longer
      timeout set.
