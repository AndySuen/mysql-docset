    Before posting a bug report about a problem, please try to verify
    that it is a bug and that it has not been reported already:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        Start by searching the MySQL online manual at
        <a class="ulink" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/" target="_top">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/</a>. We try to keep the manual up to
        date by updating it frequently with solutions to newly found
        problems. In addition, the release notes accompanying the manual
        can be particularly useful since it is quite possible that a
        newer version contains a solution to your problem. The release
        notes are available at the location just given for the manual.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        If you get a parse error for an SQL statement, please check your
        syntax closely. If you cannot find something wrong with it, it
        is extremely likely that your current version of MySQL Server
        doesn&#39;t support the syntax you are using. If you are using the
        current version and the manual doesn&#39;t cover the syntax that you
        are using, MySQL Server doesn&#39;t support your statement.
      </p><p>
        If the manual covers the syntax you are using, but you have an
        older version of MySQL Server, you should check the MySQL change
        history to see when the syntax was implemented. In this case,
        you have the option of upgrading to a newer version of MySQL
        Server.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        For solutions to some common problems, see

      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Search the bugs database at
        <a class="ulink" href="http://bugs.mysql.com/" target="_top">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a> to see whether the bug has
        been reported and fixed.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        You can also use <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mysql.com/search/" target="_top">http://www.mysql.com/search/</a> to

    If you cannot find an answer in the manual, the bugs database, or
    the mailing list archives, check with your local MySQL expert. If
    you still cannot find an answer to your question, please use the
    following guidelines for reporting the bug.
  </p><p>
    The normal way to report bugs is to visit
    <a class="ulink" href="http://bugs.mysql.com/" target="_top">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a>, which is the address for our
    bugs database. This database is public and can be browsed and
    searched by anyone. If you log in to the system, you can enter new
    reports.

  </p><p>
    Writing a good bug report takes patience, but doing it right the
    first time saves time both for us and for yourself. A good bug
    report, containing a full test case for the bug, makes it very
    likely that we will fix the bug in the next release. This section
    helps you write your report correctly so that you do not waste your
    time doing things that may not help us much or at all. Please read
    this section carefully and make sure that all the information
    described here is included in your report.
  </p><p>
    Preferably, you should test the problem using the latest production
    or development version of MySQL Server before posting. Anyone should
    be able to repeat the bug by just using <code class="literal">mysql test &lt;
    script_file</code> on your test case or by running the shell or
    Perl script that you include in the bug report. Any bug that we are
    able to repeat has a high chance of being fixed in the next MySQL
    release.
  </p><p>
    It is most helpful when a good description of the problem is
    included in the bug report. That is, give a good example of
    everything you did that led to the problem and describe, in exact
    detail, the problem itself. The best reports are those that include
    a full example showing how to reproduce the bug or problem. See
    <a class="xref" href="debugging-mysql.html" title="5.9&nbsp;Debugging MySQL">Section&nbsp;5.9, &ldquo;Debugging MySQL&rdquo;</a>.
  </p><p>
    Remember that it is possible for us to respond to a report
    containing too much information, but not to one containing too
    little. People often omit facts because they think they know the
    cause of a problem and assume that some details do not matter. A
    good principle to follow is that if you are in doubt about stating
    something, state it. It is faster and less troublesome to write a
    couple more lines in your report than to wait longer for the answer
    if we must ask you to provide information that was missing from the
    initial report.
  </p><p>
    The most common errors made in bug reports are (a) not including the
    version number of the MySQL distribution that you use, and (b) not
    fully describing the platform on which the MySQL server is installed
    (including the platform type and version number). These are highly
    relevant pieces of information, and in 99 cases out of 100, the bug
    report is useless without them. Very often we get questions like,
    <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">Why doesn&#39;t this work for me?</span>&rdquo;</span> Then we find that the
    feature requested wasn&#39;t implemented in that MySQL version, or that
    a bug described in a report has been fixed in newer MySQL versions.
    Errors often are platform-dependent. In such cases, it is next to
    impossible for us to fix anything without knowing the operating
    system and the version number of the platform.
  </p><p>
    If you compiled MySQL from source, remember also to provide
    information about your compiler if it is related to the problem.
    Often people find bugs in compilers and think the problem is
    MySQL-related. Most compilers are under development all the time and
    become better version by version. To determine whether your problem
    depends on your compiler, we need to know what compiler you used.
    Note that every compiling problem should be regarded as a bug and
    reported accordingly.
  </p><p>
    If a program produces an error message, it is very important to
    include the message in your report. If we try to search for
    something from the archives, it is better that the error message
    reported exactly matches the one that the program produces. (Even
    the lettercase should be observed.) It is best to copy and paste the
    entire error message into your report. You should never try to
    reproduce the message from memory.
  </p><p>
    If you have a problem with Connector/ODBC (MyODBC), please try to
    generate a trace file and send it with your report. See
    <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/connector-odbc-en/connector-odbc-support-bug-report.html" target="_top">How to Report Connector/ODBC Problems or Bugs</a>.
  </p><p>
    If your report includes long query output lines from test cases that
    you run with the <a class="link" href="mysql.html" title="4.5.1&nbsp;mysql &mdash; The MySQL Command-Line Client"><span class="command"><strong>mysql</strong></span></a> command-line tool, you can
    make the output more readable by using the
    <a class="link" href="mysql-command-options.html#option_mysql_vertical"><code class="option">--vertical</code></a> option or the
    <code class="literal">\G</code> statement terminator. The
    <a class="link" href="explain.html" title="13.8.2&nbsp;EXPLAIN Statement"><code class="literal">EXPLAIN SELECT</code></a>
    example later in this section demonstrates the use of
    <code class="literal">\G</code>.

        If we cannot verify the exact purpose of the patch, we will not

        Guesses about what the bug is, why it occurs, or what it depends
        on are usually wrong. Even the MySQL team cannot guess such
        things without first using a debugger to determine the real
        cause of a bug.

        If your data appears corrupt or you get errors when you access a
        particular table, first check your tables with
        <a class="link" href="check-table.html" title="13.7.3.2&nbsp;CHECK TABLE Statement"><code class="literal">CHECK TABLE</code></a>. If that statement
        reports any errors:

            The <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> crash recovery mechanism
            handles cleanup when the server is restarted after being
            killed, so in typical operation there is no need to
            <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">repair</span>&rdquo;</span> tables. If you encounter an error with
            <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> tables, restart the server and see
            whether the problem persists, or whether the error affected
            only cached data in memory. If data is corrupted on disk,
            consider restarting with the
            <a class="link" href="innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery"><code class="literal">innodb_force_recovery</code></a>
            option enabled so that you can dump the affected tables.

            For non-transactional tables, try to repair them with

        <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_lower_case_table_names"><code class="literal">lower_case_table_names</code></a> using
        the <code class="literal">SHOW VARIABLES LIKE

        affects how the server handles lettercase of database and table

        If you often get corrupted tables, you should try to find out
        when and why this happens. In this case, the error log in the
        MySQL data directory may contain some information about what
        happened. (This is the file with the <code class="filename">.err</code>
        suffix in the name.) See <a class="xref" href="error-log.html" title="5.4.2&nbsp;The Error Log">Section&nbsp;5.4.2, &ldquo;The Error Log&rdquo;</a>. Please
        include any relevant information from this file in your bug
        report. Normally <a class="link" href="mysqld.html" title="4.3.1&nbsp;mysqld &mdash; The MySQL Server"><span class="command"><strong>mysqld</strong></span></a> should
        <span class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> corrupt a table if nothing killed it
        in the middle of an update. If you can find the cause of
        <a class="link" href="mysqld.html" title="4.3.1&nbsp;mysqld &mdash; The MySQL Server"><span class="command"><strong>mysqld</strong></span></a> dying, it is much easier for us to
        provide you with a fix for the problem. See

        If possible, download and install the most recent version of
        MySQL Server and check whether it solves your problem. All
        versions of the MySQL software are thoroughly tested and should
        work without problems. We believe in making everything as
        backward-compatible as possible, and you should be able to
        switch MySQL versions without difficulty. See
