      MySQL Enterprise Monitor is an enterprise monitoring system for MySQL that keeps
      an eye on your MySQL servers, notifies you of potential issues and
      problems, and advises you how to fix the issues. MySQL Enterprise Monitor can
      monitor all kinds of configurations, from a single MySQL server
      that is important to your business, all the way up to a huge farm
      of MySQL servers powering a busy website.
    </p><p>
      The following discussion briefly summarizes the basic components
      that make up the MySQL Enterprise Monitor product. For more information, see the
      MySQL Enterprise Monitor manual, available at
      <a class="ulink" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-monitor/en/" target="_top">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-monitor/en/</a>.
    </p><p>
      MySQL Enterprise Monitor components can be installed in various configurations
      depending on your database and network topology, to give you the
      best combination of reliable and responsive monitoring data, with
      minimal overhead on the database server machines. A typical
      MySQL Enterprise Monitor installation consists of:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          One or more MySQL servers to monitor. MySQL Enterprise Monitor can monitor
          both Community and Enterprise MySQL server releases.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          A MySQL Enterprise Monitor Agent for each monitored host.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          A single MySQL Enterprise Service Manager, which collates information from the
          agents and provides the user interface to the collected data.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      MySQL Enterprise Monitor is designed to monitor one or more MySQL servers. The
      monitoring information is collected by using an agent,
      <span class="firstterm">MySQL Enterprise Monitor Agent</span>. The agent
      communicates with the hosts and MySQL servers that it monitors,
      collecting variables, status and health information, and sending
      this information to the MySQL Enterprise Service Manager.
    </p><p>
      The information collected by the agent about each MySQL server and
      host you are monitoring is sent to the
      <span class="firstterm">MySQL Enterprise Service Manager</span>. This server
      collates all of the information from the agents. As it collates
      the information sent by the agents, the MySQL Enterprise Service Manager
      continually tests the collected data, comparing the status of the
      server to reasonable values. When thresholds are reached, the
      server can trigger an event (including an alarm and notification)
      to highlight a potential issue, such as low memory, high CPU
      usage, or more complex conditions such insufficient buffer sizes
      and status information. We call each test, with its associated
      threshold value, a <span class="firstterm">rule</span>.
    </p><p>
      These rules, and the alarms and notifications, are each known as a
      <span class="firstterm">MySQL Enterprise Advisors</span>. Advisors
      form a critical part of the MySQL Enterprise Service Manager, as they provide
      warning information and troubleshooting advice about potential
      problems.
    </p><p>
      The MySQL Enterprise Service Manager includes a web server, and you interact with
      it through any web browser. This interface, the MySQL Enterprise Monitor User Interface,
      displays all of the information collected by the agents, and lets
      you view all of your servers and their current status as a group
      or individually. You control and configure all aspects of the
      service using the MySQL Enterprise Monitor User Interface.
    </p><p>
      The information supplied by the MySQL Enterprise Monitor Agent processes also
      includes statistical and query information, which you can view in
      the form of graphs. For example, you can view aspects such as
      server load, query numbers, or index usage information as a graph
      over time. The graph lets you pinpoint problems or potential
      issues on your server, and can help diagnose the impact from
      database or external problems (such as external system or network
      failure) by examining the data from a specific time interval.
    </p><p>
      The MySQL Enterprise Monitor Agent can also be configured to collect detailed
      information about the queries executed on your server, including
      the row counts and performance times for executing each query. You
      can correlate the detailed query data with the graphical
      information to identify which queries were executing when you
      experienced a particularly high load, index or other issue. The
      query data is supported by a system called Query Analyzer, and the
      data can be presented in different ways depending on your needs.
