      Beginning with MySQL 8.0.22, you can use the asynchronous
      connection failover mechanism to automatically establish an
      asynchronous (source to replica) replication connection to a new
      source after the existing connection from a replica to its source
      fails. The asynchronous connection failover mechanism can be used
      to keep a replica synchronized with multiple MySQL servers or
      groups of servers that share data. The list of potential source
      servers is stored on the replica, and in the event of a connection
      failure, a new source is selected from the list based on a
      weighted priority that you set.
    </p><p>
      From MySQL 8.0.23, the asynchronous connection failover mechanism
      also supports Group Replication topologies, by automatically
      monitoring changes to group membership and distinguishing between
      primary and secondary servers. When you add a group member to the
      source list and define it as part of a managed group, the
      asynchronous connection failover mechanism updates the source list
      to keep it in line with membership changes, adding and removing
      group members automatically as they join or leave. Only online
      group members that are in the majority are used for connections
      and obtaining status. The last remaining member of a managed group
      is not removed automatically even if it leaves the group, so that
      the configuration of the managed group is kept. However, you can
      delete a managed group manually if it is no longer needed.
    </p><p>
      From MySQL 8.0.27, the asynchronous connection failover mechanism
      also enables a replica that is part of a managed replication group
      to automatically reconnect to the sender if the current receiver
      (the primary of the group) fails. This feature works with Group
      Replication, on a group configured in single-primary mode, where
      the group&rsquo;s primary is a replica that has a replication channel
      using the mechanism. The feature is designed for a group of
      senders and a group of receivers to keep synchronized with each
      other even when some members are temporarily unavailable. It also
      synchronizes a group of receivers with one or more senders that
      are not part of a managed group. A replica that is not part of a
      replication group cannot use this feature.
    </p><p>
      The requirements for using the asynchronous connection failover
      mechanism are as follows:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          GTIDs must be in use on the source and the replica
          (<a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_mode"><code class="literal">gtid_mode=ON</code></a>), and the
          <code class="literal">SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION</code> |
          <code class="literal">MASTER_AUTO_POSITION</code> option of the
          <a class="link" href="change-replication-source-to.html" title="13.4.2.3&nbsp;CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement"><code class="literal">CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO</code></a> |
          <a class="link" href="change-master-to.html" title="13.4.2.1&nbsp;CHANGE MASTER TO Statement"><code class="literal">CHANGE MASTER TO</code></a> statement must
          be enabled on the replica, so that GTID auto-positioning is
          used for the connection to the source.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          The same replication user account and password must exist on
          all the source servers in the source list for the channel.
          This account is used for the connection to each of the
          sources. You can set up different accounts for different
          channels.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          The replication user account must be given
          <code class="literal">SELECT</code> permissions on the Performance
          Schema tables, for example, by issuing <code class="literal">GRANT SELECT
          ON performance_schema.* TO
          &#39;<em class="replaceable"><code>repl_user</code></em>&#39;;</code>
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          The replication user account and password cannot be specified
          on the statement used to start replication, because they need
          to be available on the automatic restart for the connection to
          the alternative source. They must be set for the channel using
          the <a class="link" href="change-replication-source-to.html" title="13.4.2.3&nbsp;CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement"><code class="literal">CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
          TO</code></a> | <a class="link" href="change-master-to.html" title="13.4.2.1&nbsp;CHANGE MASTER TO Statement"><code class="literal">CHANGE MASTER TO</code></a>
          statement on the replica, and recorded in the replication
          metadata repositories.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If the channel where the asynchronous connection failover
          mechanism is in use is on the primary of a Group Replication
          single-primary mode group, from MySQL 8.0.27, asynchronous
          connection failover between replicas is also active by
          default. In this situation, the replication channel and the
          replication user account and password for the channel must be
          set up on all the secondary servers in the replication group,
          and on any new joining members. If the new servers are
          provisioned using MySQL&rsquo;s clone functionality, this all
          happens automatically.
        </p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><div class="admon-title">Important</div><p>
            If you do not want asynchronous connection failover to take
            place between replicas in this situation, disable it by
            disabling the member action
            <code class="literal">mysql_start_failover_channels_if_primary</code>
            for the group, using the
            <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.html#function_group-replication-disable-member-action"><code class="literal">group_replication_disable_member_action</code></a>
            function. When the feature is disabled, you do not need to
            configure the replication channel on the secondary group
            members, but if the primary goes offline or into an error
            state, replication stops for the channel.
          </p></div></li></ul></div><p>
      From MySQL Shell 8.0.27 and MySQL 8.0.27, MySQL
      InnoDB ClusterSet is available to provide disaster tolerance for
      InnoDB Cluster deployments by linking a primary InnoDB Cluster
      with one or more replicas of itself in alternate locations, such
      as different datacenters. Consider using this solution instead to
      simplify the setup of a new multi-group deployment for
      replication, failover, and disaster recovery. You can adopt an
      existing Group Replication deployment as an InnoDB Cluster.
    </p><p>
      InnoDB ClusterSet and InnoDB Cluster are designed to abstract
      and simplify the procedures for setting up, managing, monitoring,
      recovering, and repairing replication groups. InnoDB ClusterSet
      automatically manages replication from a primary cluster to
      replica clusters using a dedicated ClusterSet replication channel.
      You can use administrator commands to trigger a controlled
      switchover or emergency failover between groups if the primary
      cluster is not functioning normally. Servers and groups can easily
      be added to or removed from the InnoDB ClusterSet deployment
      after the initial setup when demand changes. For more information,
