        With statement-based replication, triggers executed on the
        source also execute on the replica. With row-based replication,
        triggers executed on the source do not execute on the replica.
        Instead, the row changes on the source resulting from trigger
        execution are replicated and applied on the replica.
      </p><p>
        This behavior is by design. If under row-based replication the
        replica applied the triggers as well as the row changes caused
        by them, the changes would in effect be applied twice on the
        replica, leading to different data on the source and the
        replica.
      </p><p>
        If you want triggers to execute on both the source and the
        replica, perhaps because you have different triggers on the
        source and replica, you must use statement-based replication.
        However, to enable replica-side triggers, it is not necessary to
        use statement-based replication exclusively. It is sufficient to
        switch to statement-based replication only for those statements
        where you want this effect, and to use row-based replication the
        rest of the time.
      </p><p>
        A statement invoking a trigger (or function) that causes an
        update to an <code class="literal">AUTO_INCREMENT</code> column is not
        replicated correctly using statement-based replication. MySQL
        8.0 marks such statements as unsafe. (Bug #45677)
      </p><p>
        A trigger can have triggers for different combinations of
        trigger event (<a class="link" href="insert.html" title="13.2.7&nbsp;INSERT Statement"><code class="literal">INSERT</code></a>,
        <a class="link" href="update.html" title="13.2.17&nbsp;UPDATE Statement"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a>,
        <a class="link" href="delete.html" title="13.2.2&nbsp;DELETE Statement"><code class="literal">DELETE</code></a>) and action time
        (<code class="literal">BEFORE</code>, <code class="literal">AFTER</code>), and
        multiple triggers are permitted.
      </p><p>
        For brevity, <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">multiple triggers</span>&rdquo;</span> here is shorthand
        for <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">multiple triggers that have the same trigger event
        and action time.</span>&rdquo;</span>
      </p><p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>Upgrades.</strong></span> Multiple triggers are
        not supported in versions earlier than MySQL 5.7. If you upgrade
        servers in a replication topology that use a version earlier
        than MySQL 5.7, upgrade the replicas first and then upgrade the
        source. If an upgraded replication source server still has old
        replicas using MySQL versions that do not support multiple
        triggers, an error occurs on those replicas if a trigger is
        created on the source for a table that already has a trigger
        with the same trigger event and action time.
      </p><p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>Downgrades.</strong></span> If you downgrade a
        server that supports multiple triggers to an older version that
        does not, the downgrade has these effects:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            For each table that has triggers, all trigger definitions
            are in the <code class="filename">.TRG</code> file for the table.
            However, if there are multiple triggers with the same
            trigger event and action time, the server executes only one
            of them when the trigger event occurs. For information about
            <code class="literal">.TRG</code> files, see the Table Trigger Storage
            section of the MySQL Server Doxygen documentation, available
            at <a class="ulink" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html" target="_top">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html</a>.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If triggers for the table are added or dropped subsequent to
            the downgrade, the server rewrites the table&#39;s
            <code class="filename">.TRG</code> file. The rewritten file retains
            only one trigger per combination of trigger event and action
            time; the others are lost.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        To avoid these problems, modify your triggers before
        downgrading. For each table that has multiple triggers per
        combination of trigger event and action time, convert each such
        set of triggers to a single trigger as follows:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
            For each trigger, create a stored routine that contains all
            the code in the trigger. Values accessed using
            <code class="literal">NEW</code> and <code class="literal">OLD</code> can be
            passed to the routine using parameters. If the trigger needs
            a single result value from the code, you can put the code in
            a stored function and have the function return the value. If
            the trigger needs multiple result values from the code, you
            can put the code in a stored procedure and return the values
            using <code class="literal">OUT</code> parameters.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Drop all triggers for the table.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Create one new trigger for the table that invokes the stored
            routines just created. The effect for this trigger is thus
            the same as the multiple triggers it replaces.
