        MySQL Server&#39;s clone plugin is available from MySQL 8.0.17. If
        you want to use remote cloning operations for distributed
        recovery in a group, you must set up existing members and
        joining members beforehand to support this function. If you do
        not want to use this function in a group, do not set it up, in
        which case Group Replication only uses state transfer from the
        binary log.
      </p><p>
        To use cloning, at least one existing group member and the
        joining member must be set up beforehand to support remote
        cloning operations. As a minimum, you must install the clone
        plugin on the donor and joining member, grant the
        <a class="link" href="privileges-provided.html#priv_backup-admin"><code class="literal">BACKUP_ADMIN</code></a> permission to the
        replication user for distributed recovery, and set the
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_clone_threshold"><code class="literal">group_replication_clone_threshold</code></a>
        system variable to an appropriate level. To ensure the maximum
        availability of donors, it is advisable to set up all current
        and future group members to support remote cloning operations.
      </p><p>
        Be aware that a remote cloning operation removes user-created
        tablespaces and data from the joining member before transferring
        the data from the donor. If the operation is stopped while in
        progress, the joining member might be left with partial data or
        no data. This can be repaired by retrying the remote cloning
        operation, which Group Replication does automatically.

              If you do not unset the user credentials, they are

          <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_clone_threshold"><code class="literal">group_replication_clone_threshold</code></a>
          system variable specifies a threshold, expressed as a number
          of transactions, for the use of a remote cloning operation in
          distributed recovery. If the gap between the transactions on
          the donor and the transactions on the joining member is larger
          than this number, a remote cloning operation is used for state
          transfer to the joining member when this is technically
          possible. Group Replication calculates whether the threshold
          has been exceeded based on the
          <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> sets of the
          existing group members. Using a remote cloning operation in
          the event of a large transaction gap lets you add new members
          to the group without transferring the group&#39;s data to the
          server manually beforehand, and also enables a member that is
          very out of date to catch up more efficiently.

          The default setting for the

          Group Replication system variable is extremely high (the
          maximum permitted sequence number for a transaction in a
          GTID), so it effectively deactivates cloning wherever state
          transfer from the binary log is possible. To enable Group
          Replication to select a remote cloning operation for state
          transfer where this is more appropriate, set the system
          variable to specify a number of transactions as the
          transaction gap above which you want cloning to take place.

            in an active group. If a number of transactions above the
            threshold takes place in the group while the remote cloning
            operation is in progress, the joining member triggers a
            remote cloning operation again after restarting, and could
            continue this indefinitely. To avoid this situation, ensure
            that you set the threshold to a number higher than the
            number of transactions that you would expect to occur in the
            group during the time taken for the remote cloning
            operation.
          </p></div><p>
          Group Replication attempts to execute a remote cloning
          operation regardless of your threshold when state transfer
          from a donor&#39;s binary log is impossible, for example because
          the transactions needed by the joining member are not
          available in the binary log on any existing group member.
          Group Replication identifies this based on the
          <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_purged"><code class="literal">gtid_purged</code></a> sets of the
          existing group members. You cannot use the
          <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_clone_threshold"><code class="literal">group_replication_clone_threshold</code></a>
          system variable to deactivate cloning when the required
          transactions are not available in any member&#39;s binary log
          files, because in that situation cloning is the only
          alternative to transferring data to the joining member
          manually.

          When group members and joining members are set up for cloning,
          Group Replication manages remote cloning operations for you. A
          remote cloning operation might take some time to complete,
          depending on the size of the data. See
          <a class="xref" href="clone-plugin-monitoring.html" title="5.6.7.10&nbsp;Monitoring Cloning Operations">Section&nbsp;5.6.7.10, &ldquo;Monitoring Cloning Operations&rdquo;</a> for information on

            When state transfer is complete, Group Replication restarts
            the joining member to complete the process. If
            <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot"><code class="literal">group_replication_start_on_boot=OFF</code></a>
            is set on the joining member, for example because you
            specify the replication user credentials on the
            <a class="link" href="start-group-replication.html" title="13.4.3.1&nbsp;START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement"><code class="literal">START GROUP_REPLICATION</code></a>
            statement, you must issue <a class="link" href="start-group-replication.html" title="13.4.3.1&nbsp;START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement"><code class="literal">START
            GROUP_REPLICATION</code></a> manually again following this
            restart. If

            and other settings required to start Group Replication were
            set in a configuration file or using a <code class="literal">SET
            PERSIST</code> statement, you do not need to intervene
            and the process continues automatically to bring the joining
            member online.
          </p></div><p>
          If the remote cloning procedure takes a long time, in releases
          before MySQL 8.0.22, it is possible for the set of
          certification information that accumulates for the group
          during that time to become too large to transmit to the
          joining member. In that case, the joining member logs an error
          message and does not join the group. From MySQL 8.0.22, Group
          Replication manages the garbage collection process for applied
          transactions differently to avoid this scenario. In earlier
          releases, if you do see this error, after the remote cloning
          operation completes, wait two minutes to allow a round of
          garbage collection to take place to reduce the size of the
          group&#39;s certification information. Then issue the following
          statement on the joining member, so that it stops trying to
          apply the previous set of certification information:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">RESET SLAVE FOR CHANNEL group_replication_recovery;
Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
RESET REPLICA FOR CHANNEL group_replication_recovery;
</pre><p>
          A remote cloning operation clones settings that are persisted
          in tables from the donor to the recipient, as well as the
          data. Group Replication manages the settings that relate
          specifically to Group Replication channels. Group Replication
          member settings that are persisted in configuration files,
          such as the group replication local address, are not cloned
          and are not changed on the joining member. Group Replication
          also preserves the channel settings that relate to the use of
          SSL, so these are unique to the individual member.

          received state transfer by a remote cloning operation
          therefore automatically receive the replication user and
          password for distributed recovery. If you specify the
          replication user credentials on the <a class="link" href="start-group-replication.html" title="13.4.3.1&nbsp;START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement"><code class="literal">START
          GROUP_REPLICATION</code></a> statement, these are used to start
          the remote cloning operation, but they are not transferred to
          and used by the joining member after cloning. If you do not
          want the credentials transferred to new joiners and recorded
          there, ensure that you unset them before remote cloning
          operations take place, as described in
          <a class="xref" href="group-replication-distributed-recovery-securing.html" title="18.6.3&nbsp;Securing Distributed Recovery Connections">Section&nbsp;18.6.3, &ldquo;Securing Distributed Recovery Connections&rdquo;</a>,
          and use <a class="link" href="start-group-replication.html" title="13.4.3.1&nbsp;START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement"><code class="literal">START GROUP_REPLICATION</code></a>
          to supply them instead.
        </p><p>
          If a <code class="literal">PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER</code> account has been
          used to help secure the replication appliers (see
          <a class="xref" href="replication-privilege-checks-gr.html" title="17.3.3.2&nbsp;Privilege Checks For Group Replication Channels">Section&nbsp;17.3.3.2, &ldquo;Privilege Checks For Group Replication Channels&rdquo;</a>), from MySQL
          8.0.19, the <code class="literal">PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER</code> account
          and related settings from the donor are cloned to the joining
          member. If the joining member is set to start Group
          Replication on boot, it automatically uses the account for
          privilege checks on the appropriate replication channels. (In
          MySQL 8.0.18, due to a number of limitations, it is
          recommended that you do not use a
          <code class="literal">PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER</code> account with Group
          Replication channels.)

          Group Replication initiates and manages cloning operations for
          distributed recovery. Group members that have been set up to
          support cloning may also participate in cloning operations
          that a user initiates manually. For example, you might want to
          create a new server instance by cloning from a group member as
          the donor, but you do not want the new server instance to join
          the group immediately, or maybe not ever.
        </p><p>
          In all releases that support cloning, you can initiate a
          cloning operation manually involving a group member on which
          Group Replication is stopped. Note that because cloning
          requires that the active plugins on a donor and recipient must
          match, the Group Replication plugin must be installed and
          active on the other server instance, even if you do not intend
          that server instance to join a group. You can install the
          plugin by issuing this statement:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">INSTALL PLUGIN group_replication SONAME &#39;group_replication.so&#39;;
</pre><p>
          In releases before MySQL 8.0.20, you cannot initiate a cloning
          operation manually if the operation involves a group member on
          which Group Replication is running. From MySQL 8.0.20, you can
          do this, provided that the cloning operation does not remove
          and replace the data on the recipient. The statement to
          initiate the cloning operation must therefore include the
          <code class="literal">DATA DIRECTORY</code> clause if Group Replication
          is running.
