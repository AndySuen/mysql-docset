        From MySQL 8.0.26, Group Replication has the capability to set
        actions for the members of a group to take in specified
        situations. Member actions can be enabled and disabled
        individually using functions. The member actions configuration
        for a server can also be reset to the default after it has left
        the group.
      </p><p>
        Administrators (with the
        <a class="link" href="privileges-provided.html#priv_group-replication-admin"><code class="literal">GROUP_REPLICATION_ADMIN</code></a>
        privilege) can configure a member action on the group&rsquo;s
        primary using the
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.html#function_group-replication-enable-member-action"><code class="literal">group_replication_enable_member_action</code></a>
        or
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.html#function_group-replication-disable-member-action"><code class="literal">group_replication_disable_member_action</code></a>
        function. The member actions configuration, consisting of all
        the member actions and whether they are enabled or disabled, is
        then propagated to other group members and joining members using
        Group Replication&rsquo;s group messages. All group members
        therefore have the same member actions configuration. You can
        also configure member actions on a server that is not part of a
        group, as long as the Group Replication plugin is installed. In
        that case, the member actions configuration is not propagated to
        any other servers.
      </p><p>
        If the server where you use the functions to configure a member
        action is part of a group, it must be the current primary in a
        group in single-primary mode, and it must be part of the
        majority. The configuration change is tracked internally by
        Group Replication, but it is not given a GTID and is not written
        to the binary log, so it is not propagated to any servers
        outside the group, such as downstream replicas. Group
        Replication increments the version number for its member actions
        configuration each time a member action is enabled or disabled.
      </p><p>
        The member actions configuration is propagated to members as
        follows:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            When starting a group, the member actions configuration of
            the server that bootstraps the group becomes the
            configuration for the group.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If a group&rsquo;s lowest MySQL Server version supports member
            actions, joining members receive the group&rsquo;s member
            actions configuration during the state exchange process that
            takes place when they join. In that case, the joining member
            replaces its own member actions configuration with the
            group&rsquo;s.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If a joining member that supports member actions joins a
            group where the lowest MySQL Server version does not support
            member actions, it does not receive a member actions
            configuration when it joins. In that case, the joining
            member resets its own configuration to the default.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        A member that does not support member actions cannot join a
        group that has a member actions configuration, because its MySQL
        Server version is lower than the lowest version that the
        existing group members are running.
      </p><p>
        The Performance Schema table
        <a class="link" href="performance-schema-replication-group-member-actions-table.html" title="27.12.11.13&nbsp;The replication_group_member_actions Table"><code class="literal">replication_group_member_actions</code></a>
        lists the member actions that are available in the
        configuration, the events that trigger them, and whether or not
        they are currently enabled. Member actions have a priority from
        1 to 100, with lower values being actioned first. If an error
        occurs when the member action is being carried out, the failure
        of the member action can be logged but otherwise ignored. If the
        failure of the member action is considered critical, it can be
        handled according to the policy specified by the
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_exit_state_action"><code class="literal">group_replication_exit_state_action</code></a>
        system variable.
      </p><p>
        The
        <code class="literal">mysql.replication_group_configuration_version</code>
        table, which can be viewed using the Performance Schema table
        <a class="link" href="performance-schema-replication-group-configuration-version-table.html" title="27.12.11.14&nbsp;The replication_group_configuration_version Table"><code class="literal">replication_group_configuration_version</code></a>,
        records the current version of the member actions configuration.
        Whenever a member action is enabled or disabled using the
        functions, the version number is incremented.
      </p><p>
        The
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.html#function_group-replication-reset-member-actions"><code class="literal">group_replication_reset_member_actions</code></a>
        function can only be used on a server that is not part of a
        group. It resets the member actions configuration to the default
        settings, and resets its version number to 1. The server must be
        writeable (with the <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_read_only"><code class="literal">read_only</code></a>
        system variable set to <code class="literal">OFF</code>) and have the
        Group Replication plugin installed. You can use this function to
        remove the member actions configuration that a server used when
        it was part of a group, if you intend to use it as a standalone
        server with no member actions or different member actions.
      </p><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="idm45828854393440"></a>Member action:
          <code class="literal">mysql_disable_super_read_only_if_primary</code></h5></div></div></div><p>
          The member action
          <code class="literal">mysql_disable_super_read_only_if_primary</code>
          can be configured to make a group in single-primary mode stay
          in super read-only mode when a new primary is elected, so that
          the group only accepts replicated transactions and does not
          accept any direct writes from clients. This setup means that
          when a group&rsquo;s purpose is to provide a secondary backup to
          another group for disaster tolerance, you can ensure that the
          secondary group remains synchronized with the first.
        </p><p>
          By default, super read-only mode is disabled on the primary
          when it is elected, so that the primary becomes read-write,
          and accepts updates from a replication source server and from
          clients. This is the situation when the member action
          <code class="literal">mysql_disable_super_read_only_if_primary</code> is
          enabled, which is its default setting. If you set the action
          to disabled using the
          <a class="link" href="group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.html#function_group-replication-disable-member-action"><code class="literal">group_replication_disable_member_action</code></a>
          function, the primary remains in super read-only mode after
          election. In this state, it does not accept updates from any
          clients, even users who have the
          <a class="link" href="privileges-provided.html#priv_connection-admin"><code class="literal">CONNECTION_ADMIN</code></a> or
          <a class="link" href="privileges-provided.html#priv_super"><code class="literal">SUPER</code></a> privilege. It does
          continue to accept updates performed by replication threads.
