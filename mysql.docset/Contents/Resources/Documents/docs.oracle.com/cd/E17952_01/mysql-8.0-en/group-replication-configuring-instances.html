        This section explains the configuration settings required for
        MySQL Server instances that you want to use for Group
        Replication. For background information, see

          For Group Replication, data must be stored in the InnoDB
          transactional storage engine (for details of why, see
          <a class="xref" href="group-replication-requirements.html" title="18.3.1&nbsp;Group Replication Requirements">Section&nbsp;18.3.1, &ldquo;Group Replication Requirements&rdquo;</a>). The use of
          other storage engines, including the temporary
          <a class="link" href="memory-storage-engine.html" title="16.3&nbsp;The MEMORY Storage Engine"><code class="literal">MEMORY</code></a> storage engine, might
          cause errors in Group Replication. Set the
          <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_disabled_storage_engines"><code class="literal">disabled_storage_engines</code></a>
          system variable as follows to prevent their use:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">disabled_storage_engines=&#34;MyISAM,BLACKHOLE,FEDERATED,ARCHIVE,MEMORY&#34;
</pre><p>
          Note that with the <a class="link" href="myisam-storage-engine.html" title="16.2&nbsp;The MyISAM Storage Engine"><code class="literal">MyISAM</code></a> storage
          engine disabled, when you are upgrading a MySQL instance to a
          release where <a class="link" href="mysql-upgrade.html" title="4.4.5&nbsp;mysql_upgrade &mdash; Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"><span class="command"><strong>mysql_upgrade</strong></span></a> is still used
          (before MySQL 8.0.16), <a class="link" href="mysql-upgrade.html" title="4.4.5&nbsp;mysql_upgrade &mdash; Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"><span class="command"><strong>mysql_upgrade</strong></span></a> might
          fail with an error. To handle this, you can re-enable that
          storage engine while you run <a class="link" href="mysql-upgrade.html" title="4.4.5&nbsp;mysql_upgrade &mdash; Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"><span class="command"><strong>mysql_upgrade</strong></span></a>,
          then disable it again when you restart the server. For more
          information, see <a class="xref" href="mysql-upgrade.html" title="4.4.5&nbsp;mysql_upgrade &mdash; Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables">Section&nbsp;4.4.5, &ldquo;mysql_upgrade &mdash; Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables&rdquo;</a>.

          The following settings configure replication according to the
          MySQL Group Replication requirements.
        </p><pre class="programlisting">server_id=1
gtid_mode=ON
enforce_gtid_consistency=ON</pre><p>
          These settings configure the server to use the unique
          identifier number 1, to enable
          <a class="xref" href="replication-gtids.html" title="17.1.3&nbsp;Replication with Global Transaction Identifiers">Section&nbsp;17.1.3, &ldquo;Replication with Global Transaction Identifiers&rdquo;</a>, and to allow execution of
          only statements that can be safely logged using a GTID.
        </p><p>
          Up to and including MySQL 8.0.20, the following setting is
          also required:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">binlog_checksum=NONE
</pre><p>
          This setting disables checksums for events written to the
          binary log, which default to being enabled. From MySQL 8.0.21,
          Group Replication supports the presence of checksums in the
          binary log and can use them to verify the integrity of events
          on some channels, so you can use the default setting. For more
          details, see <a class="xref" href="group-replication-limitations.html" title="18.3.2&nbsp;Group Replication Limitations">Section&nbsp;18.3.2, &ldquo;Group Replication Limitations&rdquo;</a>.
        </p><p>
          If you are using a version of MySQL earlier than 8.0.3, where
          the defaults were improved for replication, you also need to
          add these lines to the member&#39;s option file. If you have any
          of these system variables in the option file in later
          versions, ensure that they are set as shown. For more details
          see <a class="xref" href="group-replication-requirements.html" title="18.3.1&nbsp;Group Replication Requirements">Section&nbsp;18.3.1, &ldquo;Group Replication Requirements&rdquo;</a>.

          At this point the option file ensures that the server is
          configured and is instructed to instantiate the replication
          infrastructure under a given configuration. The following
          section configures the Group Replication settings for the
          server.

              the GTIDs that are used when transactions received by
              group members from clients, and view change events that

              sets the network address and port which the member uses
              for internal communication with other members in the
              group. Group Replication uses this address for internal
              member-to-member connections involving remote instances of
              the group communication engine (XCom, a Paxos variant).
            </p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><div class="admon-title">Important</div><p>
                The group replication local address must be different to
                the host name and port used for SQL client connections,
                which are defined by MySQL Server&#39;s

                only be used for internal communication between the

              The network address configured by
              <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_local_address"><code class="literal">group_replication_local_address</code></a>
              must be resolvable by all group members. For example, if
              each server instance is on a different machine with a
              fixed network address, you could use the IP address of the
              machine, such as 10.0.0.1. If you use a host name, you
              must use a fully qualified name, and ensure it is
              resolvable through DNS, correctly configured
              <code class="literal">/etc/hosts</code> files, or other name
              resolution processes. From MySQL 8.0.14, IPv6 addresses
              (or host names that resolve to them) can be used as well
              as IPv4 addresses. A group can contain a mix of members
              using IPv6 and members using IPv4. For more information on
              Group Replication support for IPv6 networks and on mixed
              IPv4 and IPv6 groups, see
              <a class="xref" href="group-replication-ipv6.html" title="18.5.5&nbsp;Support For IPv6 And For Mixed IPv6 And IPv4 Groups">Section&nbsp;18.5.5, &ldquo;Support For IPv6 And For Mixed IPv6 And IPv4 Groups&rdquo;</a>.
            </p><p>
              The recommended port for
              <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_local_address"><code class="literal">group_replication_local_address</code></a>
              is 33061.
              <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_local_address"><code class="literal">group_replication_local_address</code></a>
              is used by Group Replication as the unique identifier for
              a group member within the replication group. You can use
              the same port for all members of a replication group as
              long as the host names or IP addresses are all different,
              as demonstrated in this tutorial. Alternatively you can
              use the same host name or IP address for all members as
              long as the ports are all different, for example as shown
              in <a class="xref" href="group-replication-deploying-locally.html" title="18.2.2&nbsp;Deploying Group Replication Locally">Section&nbsp;18.2.2, &ldquo;Deploying Group Replication Locally&rdquo;</a>.
            </p><p>
              The connection that an existing member offers to a joining
              member for Group Replication&#39;s distributed recovery
              process is not the network address configured by
              <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_local_address"><code class="literal">group_replication_local_address</code></a>.
              Up to MySQL 8.0.20, group members offer their standard SQL
              client connection to joining members for distributed
              recovery, as specified by MySQL Server&#39;s
              <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_hostname"><code class="literal">hostname</code></a> and
              <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_port"><code class="literal">port</code></a> system variables.
              From MySQL 8.0.21, group members may advertise an
              alternative list of distributed recovery endpoints as
              dedicated client connections for joining members. For more
              details, see
              <a class="xref" href="group-replication-distributed-recovery-connections.html" title="18.5.4.1&nbsp;Connections for Distributed Recovery">Section&nbsp;18.5.4.1, &ldquo;Connections for Distributed Recovery&rdquo;</a>.
            </p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><div class="admon-title">Important</div><p>
                Distributed recovery can fail if a joining member cannot
                correctly identify the other members using the host name
                as defined by MySQL Server&#39;s
                <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_hostname"><code class="literal">hostname</code></a> system
                variable. It is recommended that operating systems
                running MySQL have a properly configured unique host
                name, either using DNS or local settings. The host name
                that the server is using for SQL client connections can
                be verified in the <code class="literal">Member_host</code> column
                of the Performance Schema table
                <a class="link" href="performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.html" title="27.12.11.11&nbsp;The replication_group_members Table"><code class="literal">replication_group_members</code></a>.
                If multiple group members externalize a default host
                name set by the operating system, there is a chance of
                the joining member not resolving it to the correct
                member address and not being able to connect for
                distributed recovery. In this situation you can use
                MySQL Server&#39;s
                <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_report_host"><code class="literal">report_host</code></a> system
                variable to configure a unique host name to be
                externalized by each of the servers.

              The server that starts the group does not make use of this
              option, since it is the initial server and as such, it is
              in charge of bootstrapping the group. In other words, any
              existing data which is on the server bootstrapping the
              group is what is used as the data for the next joining
              member. The second server joining asks the one and only
              member in the group to join, any missing data on the
              second server is replicated from the donor data on the
              bootstrapping member, and then the group expands. The
              third server joining can ask any of these two to join,
              data is synchronized to the new member, and then the group
              expands again. Subsequent servers repeat this procedure

                When joining multiple servers at the same time, make
                sure that they point to seed members that are already in
                the group. Do not use members that are also joining the
                group as seeds, because they might not yet be in the
                group when contacted.
              </p><p>
                It is good practice to start the bootstrap member first,
                and let it create the group. Then make it the seed
                member for the rest of the members that are joining.
                This ensures that there is a group formed when joining
                the rest of the members.
              </p><p>
                Creating a group and joining multiple members at the
                same time is not supported. It might work, but chances
                are that the operations race and then the act of joining
                the group ends up in an error or a time out.
              </p></div><p>
              A joining member must communicate with a seed member using
              the same protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) that the seed member
              advertises in the
              <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_group_seeds"><code class="literal">group_replication_group_seeds</code></a>
              option. For the purpose of IP address permissions for
              Group Replication, the allowlist on the seed member must
              include an IP address for the joining member for the
              protocol offered by the seed member, or a host name that
              resolves to an address for that protocol. This address or
              host name must be set up and permitted in addition to the
              joining member&#39;s
              <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_local_address"><code class="literal">group_replication_local_address</code></a>
              if the protocol for that address does not match the seed
              member&#39;s advertised protocol. If a joining member does not
              have a permitted address for the appropriate protocol, its
              connection attempt is refused. For more information, see
              <a class="xref" href="group-replication-ip-address-permissions.html" title="18.6.4&nbsp;Group Replication IP Address Permissions">Section&nbsp;18.6.4, &ldquo;Group Replication IP Address Permissions&rdquo;</a>.

                brought down and back up again). If you bootstrap the
                group multiple times, for example when multiple server
                instances have this option set, then they could create
                an artificial split brain scenario, in which two
                distinct groups with the same name exist. Always set

          The system variables described in this tutorial are the
          required configuration settings to start a new member, but
          further system variables are also available to configure group
          members. These are listed in
          <a class="xref" href="group-replication-options.html" title="18.9&nbsp;Group Replication System Variables">Section&nbsp;18.9, &ldquo;Group Replication System Variables&rdquo;</a>.

            A number of system variables, some specific to Group
            Replication and others not, are group-wide configuration
            settings that must have the same value on all group members.
            If the group members have a value set for one of these
            system variables, and a joining member has a different value
            set for it, the joining member cannot join the group and an
            error message is returned. If the group members have a value
            set for this system variable, and the joining member does
            not support the system variable, it cannot join the group.
            These system variables are all identified in
            <a class="xref" href="group-replication-options.html" title="18.9&nbsp;Group Replication System Variables">Section&nbsp;18.9, &ldquo;Group Replication System Variables&rdquo;</a>.
