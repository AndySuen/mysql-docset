        <a class="xref" href="group-replication-understanding-consistency-guarantees.html#group-replication-synchronization-points" title="Transaction Synchronization Points">Transaction Synchronization Points</a>
        section explains that conceptually there are two synchronization
        points from which you can choose: on read or on write, these
        terms were a simplification and the terms used in Group
        Replication are: <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> transaction execution. The
        consistency level can have a different impact on read-only (RO)
        and read-write (RW) transactions processed by the group as
        demonstrated in this section.

        The following list shows the possible consistency levels that
        you can configure in Group Replication using the
        <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_consistency"><code class="literal">group_replication_consistency</code></a>
        variable, in order of increasing transaction consistency
        guarantee:

            <code class="literal">EVENTUAL</code>
          </p><p>
            Both RO and RW transactions do not wait for preceding
            transactions to be applied before executing. This was the
            behavior of Group Replication before the
            <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_consistency"><code class="literal">group_replication_consistency</code></a>
            variable was added. A RW transaction does not wait for other
            members to apply a transaction. This means that a
            transaction could be externalized on one member before the
            others. This also means that in the event of a primary
            failover, the new primary can accept new RO and RW
            transactions before the previous primary transactions are
            all applied. RO transactions could result in outdated
            values, RW transactions could result in a rollback due to
            conflicts.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

          </p><p>
            New RO or RW transactions with a newly elected primary that
            is applying backlog from the old primary are held (not
            applied) until any backlog has been applied. This ensures
            that when a primary failover happens, intentionally or not,
            clients always see the latest value on the primary. This
            guarantees consistency, but means that clients must be able
            to handle the delay in the event that a backlog is being
            applied. Usually this delay should be minimal, but it does
            depend on the size of the backlog.

            <code class="literal">BEFORE</code>
          </p><p>
            A RW transaction waits for all preceding transactions to
            complete before being applied. A RO transaction waits for
            all preceding transactions to complete before being
            executed. This ensures that this transaction reads the
            latest value by only affecting the latency of the
            transaction. This reduces the overhead of synchronization on
            every RW transaction, by ensuring synchronization is used
            only on RO transactions. This consistency level also
            includes the consistency guarantees provided by
            <code class="literal">BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER</code>.

            <code class="literal">AFTER</code>
          </p><p>
            A RW transaction waits until its changes have been applied
            to all of the other members. This value has no effect on RO
            transactions. This mode ensures that when a transaction is
            committed on the local member, any subsequent transaction
            reads the written value or a more recent value on any group
            member. Use this mode with a group that is used for
            predominantly RO operations to ensure that applied RW
            transactions are applied everywhere once they commit. This
            could be used by your application to ensure that subsequent
            reads fetch the latest data which includes the latest
            writes. This reduces the overhead of synchronization on
            every RO transaction, by ensuring synchronization is used
            only on RW transactions. This consistency level also
            includes the consistency guarantees provided by

            A RW transaction waits for 1) all preceding transactions to
            complete before being applied and 2) until its changes have
            been applied on other members. A RO transaction waits for
            all preceding transactions to complete before execution
            takes place. This consistency level also includes the
            consistency guarantees provided by

        The <code class="literal">BEFORE</code> and
        <code class="literal">BEFORE_AND_AFTER</code> consistency levels can be
        both used on RO and RW transactions. The
        <code class="literal">AFTER</code> consistency level has no impact on RO
        transactions, because they do not generate changes.

          The different consistency levels provide flexibility to both
          DBAs, who can use them to set up their infrastructure; and to
          developers who can use the consistency level that best suits
          their application&#39;s requirements. The following scenarios show
          how to choose a consistency guarantee level based on how you
          use your group:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>

              <code class="literal">AFTER</code>.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              <span class="emphasis"><em>Scenario 2</em></span> you have a data set that

              reads without having to worry about reading stale data. In

            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              <span class="emphasis"><em>Scenario 3</em></span> you want specific

              data) you want to enforce that reads always read the most
              up to date value. In this case, you should choose

              do not pay the synchronization on every RO transaction,
              but only on RW ones. In this case, you should choose

            </p></li></ul></div><p>
          You have the freedom to choose the scope at which the
          consistency level is enforced. This is important because
          consistency levels could have a negative impact on group
          performance if you set them at a global scope. Therefore you
          can configure the consistency level of a group by using the
          <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_consistency"><code class="literal">group_replication_consistency</code></a>
          system variable at different scopes.
        </p><p>
          To enforce the consistency level on the current session, use
          the session scope:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&gt; SET @@SESSION.group_replication_consistency= &#39;BEFORE&#39;;
</pre><p>
          To enforce the consistency level on all sessions, use the
          global scope:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&gt; SET @@GLOBAL.group_replication_consistency= &#39;BEFORE&#39;;
</pre><p>
          The possibility of setting the consistency level on specific
          sessions enables you to take advantage of scenarios such as:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              <span class="emphasis"><em>Scenario 6</em></span> A given system handles
              several instructions that do not require a strong
              consistency level, but one kind of instruction does
              require strong consistency: managing access permissions to
              documents;. In this scenario, the system changes access
              permissions and it wants to be sure that all clients see
              the correct permission. You only need to <code class="literal">SET
              @@SESSION.group_replication_consistency=
              &lsquo;AFTER&rsquo;</code>, on those instructions and leave the
              other instructions to run with <code class="literal">EVENTUAL</code>
              set at the global scope.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              <span class="emphasis"><em>Scenario 7</em></span> On the same system as
              described in Scenario 6, every day an instruction needs to
              do some analytical processing, and as such it requires to
              always read the most up-to-date data. To achieve this, you
              only need to <code class="literal">SET
              @@SESSION.group_replication_consistency=
              &lsquo;BEFORE&rsquo;</code> on that specific instruction.
            </p></li></ul></div><p>
          To summarize, you do not need to run all transactions with a
          specific consistency level, especially if only some
          transactions actually require it.
        </p><p>
          Note that all read-write transactions are totally ordered in
          Group Replication, so even when you set the consistency level
          to <code class="literal">AFTER</code> for the current session this
          transaction waits until its changes are applied on all
          members, which means waiting for this and all preceding
          transactions that could be in the secondaries&#39; queues. In
          practice, the consistency level <code class="literal">AFTER</code> waits
          for everything until and including this transaction.
        </p></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="group-replication-consistency-level-impacts"></a>Impacts of Consistency Levels</h5></div></div></div><a id="idm45828854221328" class="indexterm"></a><p>
          Another way to classify the consistency levels is in terms of
          impact on the group, that is, the repercussions that the
          consistency levels have on the other members.
        </p><p>
          The <code class="literal">BEFORE</code> consistency level, apart from
          being ordered on the transaction stream, only impacts on the
          local member. That is, it does not require coordination with
          the other members and does not have repercussions on their
          transactions. In other words, <code class="literal">BEFORE</code> only
          impacts the transactions on which it is used.
        </p><p>
          The <code class="literal">AFTER</code> and
          <code class="literal">BEFORE_AND_AFTER</code> consistency levels do have
          side-effects on concurrent transactions executed on other
          members. These consistency levels make the other members
          transactions wait if transactions with the
          <code class="literal">EVENTUAL</code> consistency level start while a
          transaction with <code class="literal">AFTER</code> or
          <code class="literal">BEFORE_AND_AFTER</code> is executing. The other
          members wait until the <code class="literal">AFTER</code> transaction is
          committed on that member, even if the other member&#39;s
          transactions have the <code class="literal">EVENTUAL</code> consistency
          level. In other words, <code class="literal">AFTER</code> and
          <code class="literal">BEFORE_AND_AFTER</code> impact
          <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> <code class="literal">ONLINE</code> group
          members.
        </p><p>
          To illustrate this further, imagine a group with 3 members,
          M1, M2 and M3. On member M1 a client issues:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&gt; SET @@SESSION.group_replication_consistency= AFTER;
&gt; BEGIN;
&gt; INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1);
&gt; COMMIT;
</pre><p>
          Then, while the above transaction is being applied, on member
          M2 a client issues:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&gt; SET SESSION group_replication_consistency= EVENTUAL;
</pre><p>
          In this situation, even though the second transaction&#39;s
          consistency level is <code class="literal">EVENTUAL</code>, because it
          starts executing while the first transaction is already in the
          commit phase on M2, the second transaction has to wait for the
          first transaction to finish the commit and only then can it
          execute.
        </p><p>
          You can only use the consistency levels
          <code class="literal">BEFORE</code>, <code class="literal">AFTER</code> and
          <code class="literal">BEFORE_AND_AFTER</code> on
          <code class="literal">ONLINE</code> members, attempting to use them on
          members in other states causes a session error.
        </p><p>
          Transactions whose consistency level is not
          <code class="literal">EVENTUAL</code> hold execution until a timeout,
          configured by <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_wait_timeout"><code class="literal">wait_timeout</code></a>
          value is reached, which defaults to 8 hours. If the timeout is
          reached an <code class="literal">ER_GR_HOLD_WAIT_TIMEOUT</code> error is
          thrown.
        </p></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="group-replication-consistency-level-impact-election"></a>Impact of Consistency on Primary Election</h5></div></div></div><a id="idm45828854196112" class="indexterm"></a><p>
          This section describes how a group&#39;s consistency level impacts
          on a single-primary group that has elected a new primary. Such
          a group automatically detects failures and adjusts the view of
          the members that are active, in other words the membership
          configuration. Furthermore, if a group is deployed in
          single-primary mode, whenever the group&#39;s membership changes
          there is a check performed to detect if there is still a
          primary member in the group. If there is none, a new one is
          selected from the list of secondary members. Typically, this
          is known as the secondary promotion.
        </p><p>
          

          Given the fact that the system detects failures and
          reconfigures itself automatically, the user may also expect
          that once the promotion takes place, the new primary is in the
          exact state, data-wise, as that of the old one. In other
          words, the user may expect that there is no backlog of
          replicated transactions to be applied on the new primary once
          he is able to read from and write to it. In practical terms,
          the user may expect that once his application fails-over to
          the new primary, there would be no chance, even if
          temporarily, to read old data or write into old data records.
        </p><p>
          When flow control is activated and properly tuned on a group,
          there is only a small chance of transiently reading stale data
          from a newly elected primary immediately after the promotion,
          as there should not be a backlog, or if there is one it should
          be small. Moreover, you might have a proxy or middleware
          layers that govern application accesses to the primary after a
          promotion and enforce the consistency criteria at that level.
          If your group members are using MySQL 8.0.14 or higher, you
          can specify the behavior of the new primary once it is
          promoted using the
          <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_consistency"><code class="literal">group_replication_consistency</code></a>
          variable, which controls whether a newly elected primary
          blocks both reads and writes until after the backlog is fully
          applied or if it behaves in the manner of members running
          MySQL 8.0.13 or earlier. If the
          <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_consistency"><code class="literal">group_replication_consistency</code></a>
          option was set to
          <code class="literal">BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER</code> on a newly
          elected primary which has backlog to apply, and transactions
          are issued against the new primary while it is still applying
          the backlog, incoming transactions are blocked until the
          backlog is fully applied. Thus, the following anomalies are
          prevented:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              No stale reads for read-only and read-write transactions.
              This prevents stale reads from being externalized to the
              application by the new primary.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              No spurious roll backs for read-write transactions, due to
              write-write conflicts with replicated read-write
              transactions still in the backlog waiting to be applied.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              No read skew on read-write transactions, such as:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">&gt; BEGIN;
&gt; SELECT x FROM t1; -- x=1 because x=2 is in the backlog;
&gt; INSERT x INTO t2;
&gt; COMMIT;
</pre><p>
              This query should not cause a conflict but writes outdated
              values.
            </p></li></ul></div><p>
          To summarize, when
          <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_consistency"><code class="literal">group_replication_consistency</code></a>
          is set to <code class="literal">BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER</code> you
          are choosing to prioritize consistency over availability,
          because reads and writes are held whenever a new primary is
          elected. This is the trade-off you have to consider when
          configuring your group. It should also be remembered that if
          flow control is working correctly, backlog should be minimal.
          Note that the higher consistency levels
          <code class="literal">BEFORE</code>, <code class="literal">AFTER</code>, and
          <code class="literal">BEFORE_AND_AFTER</code> also include the
          consistency guarantees provided by
          <code class="literal">BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER</code>.
        </p><p>
          To guarantee that the group provides the same consistency
          level regardless of which member is promoted to primary, all
          members of the group should have
          <code class="literal">BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER</code> (or a higher
          consistency level) persisted to their configuration. For
          example, on each member issue:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&gt; SET PERSIST group_replication_consistency=&#39;BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER&#39;;
</pre><p>
          This ensures that the members all behave in the same way, and
          that the configuration is persisted after a restart of the
          member.
        </p><p>
          A transaction cannot be on-hold forever, and if the time held
          exceeds <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_wait_timeout"><code class="literal">wait_timeout</code></a> it
          returns an <span class="errortext">ER_GR_HOLD_WAIT_TIMEOUT</span>
          error.

          Although all writes are held when using
          <code class="literal">BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER</code> consistency
          level, not all reads are blocked to ensure that you can still
          inspect the server while it is applying backlog after a
          promotion took place. This is useful for debugging,
          monitoring, observability and troubleshooting. Some queries
          that do not modify data are allowed, such as the following:
