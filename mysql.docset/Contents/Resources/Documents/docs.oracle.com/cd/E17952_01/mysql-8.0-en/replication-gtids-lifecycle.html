      The life cycle of a GTID consists of the following steps:
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
          A transaction is executed and committed on the source. This
          client transaction is assigned a GTID composed of the source&#39;s
          UUID and the smallest nonzero transaction sequence number not
          yet used on this server. The GTID is written to the source&#39;s
          binary log (immediately preceding the transaction itself in
          the log). If a client transaction is not written to the binary
          log (for example, because the transaction was filtered out, or
          the transaction was read-only), it is not assigned a GTID.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If a GTID was assigned for the transaction, the GTID is
          persisted atomically at commit time by writing it to the
          binary log at the beginning of the transaction (as a
          <code class="literal">Gtid_log_event</code>). Whenever the binary log is
          rotated or the server is shut down, the server writes GTIDs
          for all transactions that were written into the previous
          binary log file into the
          <code class="literal">mysql.gtid_executed</code> table.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If a GTID was assigned for the transaction, the GTID is
          externalized non-atomically (very shortly after the
          transaction is committed) by adding it to the set of GTIDs in
          the <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> system
          variable (<code class="literal">@@GLOBAL.gtid_executed</code>). This
          GTID set contains a representation of the set of all committed
          GTID transactions, and it is used in replication as a token
          that represents the server state. With binary logging enabled
          (as required for the source), the set of GTIDs in the
          <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> system variable
          is a complete record of the transactions applied, but the
          <code class="literal">mysql.gtid_executed</code> table is not, because
          the most recent history is still in the current binary log
          file.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          After the binary log data is transmitted to the replica and
          stored in the replica&#39;s relay log (using established
          mechanisms for this process, see
          <a class="xref" href="replication-implementation.html" title="17.2&nbsp;Replication Implementation">Section&nbsp;17.2, &ldquo;Replication Implementation&rdquo;</a>, for details),
          the replica reads the GTID and sets the value of its
          <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_next"><code class="literal">gtid_next</code></a> system variable as
          this GTID. This tells the replica that the next transaction
          must be logged using this GTID. It is important to note that
          the replica sets <code class="literal">gtid_next</code> in a session
          context.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          The replica verifies that no thread has yet taken ownership of
          the GTID in <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_next"><code class="literal">gtid_next</code></a> in
          order to process the transaction. By reading and checking the
          replicated transaction&#39;s GTID first, before processing the
          transaction itself, the replica guarantees not only that no
          previous transaction having this GTID has been applied on the
          replica, but also that no other session has already read this
          GTID but has not yet committed the associated transaction. So
          if multiple clients attempt to apply the same transaction
          concurrently, the server resolves this by letting only one of
          them execute. The <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_owned"><code class="literal">gtid_owned</code></a>
          system variable (<code class="literal">@@GLOBAL.gtid_owned</code>) for
          the replica shows each GTID that is currently in use and the
          ID of the thread that owns it. If the GTID has already been
          used, no error is raised, and the auto-skip function is used
          to ignore the transaction.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If the GTID has not been used, the replica applies the
          replicated transaction. Because
          <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_next"><code class="literal">gtid_next</code></a> is set to the GTID
          already assigned by the source, the replica does not attempt
          to generate a new GTID for this transaction, but instead uses
          the GTID stored in <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_next"><code class="literal">gtid_next</code></a>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If binary logging is enabled on the replica, the GTID is
          persisted atomically at commit time by writing it to the
          binary log at the beginning of the transaction (as a
          <code class="literal">Gtid_log_event</code>). Whenever the binary log is
          rotated or the server is shut down, the server writes GTIDs
          for all transactions that were written into the previous
          binary log file into the
          <code class="literal">mysql.gtid_executed</code> table.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If binary logging is disabled on the replica, the GTID is
          persisted atomically by writing it directly into the
          <code class="literal">mysql.gtid_executed</code> table. MySQL appends a
          statement to the transaction to insert the GTID into the
          table. From MySQL 8.0, this operation is atomic for DDL
          statements as well as for DML statements. In this situation,
          the <code class="literal">mysql.gtid_executed</code> table is a complete
          record of the transactions applied on the replica.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Very shortly after the replicated transaction is committed on
          the replica, the GTID is externalized non-atomically by adding
          it to the set of GTIDs in the
          <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> system variable
          (<code class="literal">@@GLOBAL.gtid_executed</code>) for the replica.
          As for the source, this GTID set contains a representation of
          the set of all committed GTID transactions. If binary logging
          is disabled on the replica, the
          <code class="literal">mysql.gtid_executed</code> table is also a
          complete record of the transactions applied on the replica. If
          binary logging is enabled on the replica, meaning that some
          GTIDs are only recorded in the binary log, the set of GTIDs in
          the <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> system
          variable is the only complete record.
        </p></li></ol></div><p>
      Client transactions that are completely filtered out on the source
      are not assigned a GTID, therefore they are not added to the set
      of transactions in the
      <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> system variable, or
      added to the <code class="literal">mysql.gtid_executed</code> table.
      However, the GTIDs of replicated transactions that are completely
      filtered out on the replica are persisted. If binary logging is
      enabled on the replica, the filtered-out transaction is written to
      the binary log as a <code class="literal">Gtid_log_event</code> followed by
      an empty transaction containing only <code class="literal">BEGIN</code> and
      <code class="literal">COMMIT</code> statements. If binary logging is
      disabled, the GTID of the filtered-out transaction is written to
      the <code class="literal">mysql.gtid_executed</code> table. Preserving the
      GTIDs for filtered-out transactions ensures that the
      <code class="literal">mysql.gtid_executed</code> table and the set of GTIDs
      in the <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> system
      variable can be compressed. It also ensures that the filtered-out
      transactions are not retrieved again if the replica reconnects to
      the source, as explained in
      <a class="xref" href="replication-gtids-auto-positioning.html" title="17.1.3.3&nbsp;GTID Auto-Positioning">Section&nbsp;17.1.3.3, &ldquo;GTID Auto-Positioning&rdquo;</a>.
    </p><p>
      On a multithreaded replica (with
      <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers"><code class="literal">replica_parallel_workers &gt; 0</code></a> or
      <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers"><code class="literal">slave_parallel_workers &gt; 0</code></a> ),
      transactions can be applied in parallel, so replicated
      transactions can commit out of order (unless
      <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order"><code class="literal">replica_preserve_commit_order=1</code></a>
      or <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order"><code class="literal">slave_preserve_commit_order=1</code></a>
      is set). When that happens, the set of GTIDs in the
      <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> system variable
      contains multiple GTID ranges with gaps between them. (On a source
      or a single-threaded replica, there are monotonically increasing
      GTIDs without gaps between the numbers.) Gaps on multithreaded
      replicas only occur among the most recently applied transactions,
      and are filled in as replication progresses. When replication
      threads are stopped cleanly using the
      <a class="link" href="stop-replica.html" title="13.4.2.10&nbsp;STOP REPLICA Statement"><code class="literal">STOP
      REPLICA</code></a> statement, ongoing transactions are applied so
      that the gaps are filled in. In the event of a shutdown such as a
      server failure or the use of the
      <a class="link" href="kill.html" title="13.7.8.4&nbsp;KILL Statement"><code class="literal">KILL</code></a> statement to stop replication
      threads, the gaps might remain.
    </p><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="replication-gtids-assign"></a>What changes are assigned a GTID?</h5></div></div></div><p>
        The typical scenario is that the server generates a new GTID for
        a committed transaction. However, GTIDs can also be assigned to
        other changes besides transactions, and in some cases a single
        transaction can be assigned multiple GTIDs.
      </p><p>
        Every database change (DDL or DML) that is written to the binary
        log is assigned a GTID. This includes changes that are
        autocommitted, and changes that are committed using
        <code class="literal">BEGIN</code> and <code class="literal">COMMIT</code> or
        <code class="literal">START TRANSACTION</code> statements. A GTID is also
        assigned to the creation, alteration, or deletion of a database,
        and of a non-table database object such as a procedure,
        function, trigger, event, view, user, role, or grant.
      </p><p>
        Non-transactional updates as well as transactional updates are
        assigned GTIDs. In addition, for a non-transactional update, if
        a disk write failure occurs while attempting to write to the
        binary log cache and a gap is therefore created in the binary
        log, the resulting incident log event is assigned a GTID.
      </p><p>
        When a table is automatically dropped by a generated statement
        in the binary log, a GTID is assigned to the statement.
        Temporary tables are dropped automatically when a replica begins
        to apply events from a source that has just been started, and
        when statement-based replication is in use
        (<a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format=STATEMENT</code></a>) and a
        user session that has open temporary tables disconnects. Tables
        that use the <a class="link" href="memory-storage-engine.html" title="16.3&nbsp;The MEMORY Storage Engine"><code class="literal">MEMORY</code></a> storage engine
        are deleted automatically the first time they are accessed after
        the server is started, because rows might have been lost during
        the shutdown.
      </p><p>
        When a transaction is not written to the binary log on the
        server of origin, the server does not assign a GTID to it. This
        includes transactions that are rolled back and transactions that
        are executed while binary logging is disabled on the server of
        origin, either globally (with <code class="literal">--skip-log-bin</code>
        specified in the server&#39;s configuration) or for the session
        (<code class="literal">SET @@SESSION.sql_log_bin = 0</code>). This also
        includes no-op transactions when row-based replication is in use
        (<a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format=ROW</code></a>).
      </p><p>
        XA transactions are assigned separate GTIDs for the <code class="literal">XA
        PREPARE</code> phase of the transaction and the <code class="literal">XA
        COMMIT</code> or <code class="literal">XA ROLLBACK</code> phase of the
        transaction. XA transactions are persistently prepared so that
        users can commit them or roll them back in the case of a failure
        (which in a replication topology might include a failover to
        another server). The two parts of the transaction are therefore
        replicated separately, so they must have their own GTIDs, even
        though a non-XA transaction that is rolled back would not have a
        GTID.
      </p><p>
        In the following special cases, a single statement can generate
        multiple transactions, and therefore be assigned multiple GTIDs:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            A stored procedure is invoked that commits multiple
            transactions. One GTID is generated for each transaction
            that the procedure commits.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            A multi-table <a class="link" href="drop-table.html" title="13.1.32&nbsp;DROP TABLE Statement"><code class="literal">DROP TABLE</code></a>
            statement drops tables of different types. Multiple GTIDs
            can be generated if any of the tables use storage engines
            that do not support atomic DDL, or if any of the tables are
            temporary tables.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            A

            (<a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format=ROW</code></a>). One
            GTID is generated for the <a class="link" href="create-table.html" title="13.1.20&nbsp;CREATE TABLE Statement"><code class="literal">CREATE
            TABLE</code></a> action and one GTID is generated for the

        By default, for new transactions committed in user sessions, the
        server automatically generates and assigns a new GTID. When the
        transaction is applied on a replica, the GTID from the server of
        origin is preserved. You can change this behavior by setting the
        session value of the <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_next"><code class="literal">gtid_next</code></a>
        system variable:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            When <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_next"><code class="literal">gtid_next</code></a> is set to
            <code class="literal">AUTOMATIC</code>, which is the default, and a
            transaction is committed and written to the binary log, the
            server automatically generates and assigns a new GTID. If a
            transaction is rolled back or not written to the binary log
            for another reason, the server does not generate and assign
            a GTID.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If you set <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_next"><code class="literal">gtid_next</code></a> to a
            valid GTID (consisting of a UUID and a transaction sequence
            number, separated by a colon), the server assigns that GTID
            to your transaction. This GTID is assigned and added to
            <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> even when the
            transaction is not written to the binary log, or when the
            transaction is empty.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        Note that after you set
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_next"><code class="literal">gtid_next</code></a> to a specific GTID,
        and the transaction has been committed or rolled back, an
        explicit <code class="literal">SET @@SESSION.gtid_next</code> statement
        must be issued before any other statement. You can use this to
        set the GTID value back to <code class="literal">AUTOMATIC</code> if you
        do not want to assign any more GTIDs explicitly.
      </p><p>
        When replication applier threads apply replicated transactions,
        they use this technique, setting
        <code class="literal">@@SESSION.gtid_next</code> explicitly to the GTID of
        the replicated transaction as assigned on the server of origin.
        This means the GTID from the server of origin is retained,
        rather than a new GTID being generated and assigned by the
        replica. It also means the GTID is added to
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> on the replica
        even when binary logging or replica update logging is disabled
        on the replica, or when the transaction is a no-op or is
        filtered out on the replica.
      </p><p>
        It is possible for a client to simulate a replicated transaction
        by setting <code class="literal">@@SESSION.gtid_next</code> to a specific
        GTID before executing the transaction. This technique is used by
        <a class="link" href="mysqlbinlog.html" title="4.6.9&nbsp;mysqlbinlog &mdash; Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"><span class="command"><strong>mysqlbinlog</strong></span></a> to generate a dump of the binary
        log that the client can replay to preserve GTIDs. A simulated
        replicated transaction committed through a client is completely
        equivalent to a replicated transaction committed through a
        replication applier thread, and they cannot be distinguished
        after the fact.

        You can change the value of
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_purged"><code class="literal">gtid_purged</code></a> in order to record
        on the server that the transactions in a certain GTID set have
        been applied, although they do not exist in any binary log on
        the server. When you add GTIDs to
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_purged"><code class="literal">gtid_purged</code></a>, they are also
        added to <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a>. An
        example use case for this action is when you are restoring a
        backup of one or more databases on a server, but you do not have
        the relevant binary logs containing the transactions on the
        server. Before MySQL 8.0, you could only change the value of
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_purged"><code class="literal">gtid_purged</code></a> when
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> (and therefore
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_purged"><code class="literal">gtid_purged</code></a>) was empty. From
        MySQL 8.0, this restriction does not apply, and you can also
        choose whether to replace the whole GTID set in
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_purged"><code class="literal">gtid_purged</code></a> with a specified
        GTID set, or to add a specified GTID set to the GTIDs already in
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_purged"><code class="literal">gtid_purged</code></a>. For details of how
        to do this, see the description for

        are initialized when the server starts. Every binary log file
        begins with the event
        <code class="literal">Previous_gtids_log_event</code>, which contains the
        set of GTIDs in all previous binary log files (composed from the
        GTIDs in the preceding file&#39;s

        every <code class="literal">Gtid_log_event</code> in the preceding file
        itself). The contents of
        <code class="literal">Previous_gtids_log_event</code> in the oldest and
        most recent binary log files are used to compute the
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> and
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_purged"><code class="literal">gtid_purged</code></a> sets at server

            <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> is computed

            <code class="literal">Previous_gtids_log_event</code> in the most

            on the server, whether or not they are currently in a binary
            log file on the server. It does not include the GTIDs for
            transactions that are currently being processed on the
            server (<code class="literal">@@GLOBAL.gtid_owned</code>).

            <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_purged"><code class="literal">gtid_purged</code></a> is computed by
            first adding the GTIDs in
            <code class="literal">Previous_gtids_log_event</code> in the most
            recent binary log file and the GTIDs of transactions in that
            binary log file. This step gives the set of GTIDs that are
            currently, or were once, recorded in a binary log on the
            server (<code class="literal">gtids_in_binlog</code>). Next, the GTIDs
            in <code class="literal">Previous_gtids_log_event</code> in the oldest
            binary log file are subtracted from
            <code class="literal">gtids_in_binlog</code>. This step gives the set
            of GTIDs that are currently recorded in a binary log on the
            server (<code class="literal">gtids_in_binlog_not_purged</code>).
            Finally, <code class="literal">gtids_in_binlog_not_purged</code> is
            subtracted from
            <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a>. The result
            is the set of GTIDs that have been used on the server, but
            are not currently recorded in a binary log file on the
            server, and this result is used to initialize
            <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_purged"><code class="literal">gtid_purged</code></a>.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        If binary logs from MySQL 5.7.7 or older are involved in these
        computations, it is possible for incorrect GTID sets to be
        computed for <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> and
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_purged"><code class="literal">gtid_purged</code></a>, and they remain
        incorrect even if the server is later restarted. For details,
        see the description for the
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_binlog_gtid_simple_recovery"><code class="literal">binlog_gtid_simple_recovery</code></a>
        system variable, which controls how the binary logs are iterated
        to compute the GTID sets. If one of the situations described
        there applies on a server, set
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_binlog_gtid_simple_recovery"><code class="literal">binlog_gtid_simple_recovery=FALSE</code></a>
        in the server&#39;s configuration file before starting it. That
        setting makes the server iterate all the binary log files (not
        just the newest and oldest) to find where GTID events start to
        appear. This process could take a long time if the server has a
        large number of binary log files without GTID events.

        If you need to reset the GTID execution history on a server, use
        the <a class="link" href="reset-master.html" title="13.4.1.2&nbsp;RESET MASTER Statement"><code class="literal">RESET MASTER</code></a> statement. For
        example, you might need to do this after carrying out test
        queries to verify a replication setup on new GTID-enabled
        servers, or when you want to join a new server to a replication
        group but it contains some unwanted local transactions that are

        <a class="link" href="replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> system variable
        (for example, by issuing a <code class="literal">SELECT
