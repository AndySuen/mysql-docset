        Group Replication&#39;s distributed recovery process has a number of
        built-in measures to ensure fault tolerance in the event of any
        problems during the process.
      </p><p>
        The donor for distributed recovery is selected randomly from the
        existing list of suitable online group members in the current
        view. Selecting a random donor means that there is a good chance
        that the same server is not selected more than once when
        multiple members enter the group. From MySQL 8.0.17, for state
        transfer from the binary log, the joiner only selects a donor
        that is running a lower or equal patch version of MySQL Server
        compared to itself. For earlier releases, all of the online
        members are allowed to be a donor. For a remote cloning
        operation, the joiner only selects a donor that is running the
        same patch version as itself. Note that when the joining member
        has restarted at the end of the operation, it establishes a
        connection with a new donor for state transfer from the binary
        log, which might be a different member from the original donor
        used for the remote cloning operation.
      </p><p>
        In the following situations, Group Replication detects an error
        in distributed recovery, automatically switches over to a new
        donor, and retries the state transfer:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Connection error</em></span> - There is an
            authentication issue or another problem with making the
            connection to a candidate donor.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Replication errors</em></span> - One of the
            replication threads (the receiver or applier threads) being
            used for state transfer from the binary log fails. Because
            this method of state transfer uses the existing MySQL
            replication framework, it is possible that some transient
            errors could cause errors in the receiver or applier
            threads.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Remote cloning operation errors</em></span> - A
            remote cloning operation fails or is stopped before it
            completes.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Donor leaves the group</em></span> - The donor
            leaves the group, or Group Replication is stopped on the

        The Performance Schema table
        <a class="link" href="performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-worker-table.html" title="27.12.11.8&nbsp;The replication_applier_status_by_worker Table"><code class="literal">replication_applier_status_by_worker</code></a>
        displays the error that caused the last retry. In these
        situations, the new connection following the error is attempted
        with a new candidate donor. Selecting a different donor in the
        event of an error means that there is a chance the new candidate
        donor does not have the same error. If the clone plugin is
        installed, Group Replication attempts a remote cloning operation
        with each of the suitable online clone-supporting donors first.
        If all those attempts fail, Group Replication attempts state
        transfer from the binary log with all the suitable donors in
        turn, if that is possible.
      </p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><div class="admon-title">Warning</div><p>
          For a remote cloning operation, user-created tablespaces and
          data on the recipient (the joining member) are dropped before
          the remote cloning operation begins to transfer the data from
          the donor. If the remote cloning operation starts but does not
          complete, the joining member might be left with a partial set
          of its original data files, or with no user data. Data
          transferred by the donor is removed from the recipient if the
          cloning operation is stopped before the data is fully cloned.
          This situation can be repaired by retrying the cloning
          operation, which Group Replication does automatically.
        </p></div><p>
        In the following situations, the distributed recovery process
        cannot be completed, and the joining member leaves the group:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>

            are required by the joining member are not present in any
            online group member&#39;s binary log files, and the data cannot
            be obtained by a remote cloning operation (because the clone
            plugin is not installed, or because cloning was attempted
            with all possible donors but failed). The joining member is
            therefore unable to catch up with the group.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Extra transactions</em></span> - The joining member
            already contains some transactions that are not present in
            the group. If a remote cloning operation was carried out,
            these transactions would be deleted and lost, because the
            data directory on the joining member is erased. If state
            transfer from a donor&#39;s binary log was carried out, these
            transactions could conflict with the group&#39;s transactions.
