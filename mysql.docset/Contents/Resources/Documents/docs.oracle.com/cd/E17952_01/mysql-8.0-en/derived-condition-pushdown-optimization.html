          MySQL 8.0.22 and later supports derived condition pushdown for
          eligible subqueries. For a query such as <code class="literal">SELECT *
          FROM (SELECT i, j FROM t1) AS dt WHERE i &gt;
          <em class="replaceable"><code>constant</code></em></code>, it is possible
          in many cases to push the outer <code class="literal">WHERE</code>
          condition down to the derived table, in this case resulting in
          <code class="literal">SELECT * FROM (SELECT i, j FROM t1 WHERE i &gt;
          <em class="replaceable"><code>constant</code></em>) AS dt</code>. When a
          derived table cannot be merged into the outer query (for
          example, if the derived table uses aggregation), pushing the
          outer <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition down to the derived
          table should decrease the number of rows that need to be
          processed and thus speed up execution of the query.
        </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><div class="admon-title">Note</div><p>
            Prior to MySQL 8.0.22, if a derived table was materialized
            but not merged, MySQL materialized the entire table, then
            qualified all of the resulting rows with the
            <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition. This is still the case
            if derived condition pushdown is not enabled, or cannot be
            employed for some other reason.
          </p></div><p>
          Outer <code class="literal">WHERE</code> conditions can be pushed down
          to derived materialized tables under the following
          circumstances:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              When the derived table uses no aggregate or window
              functions, the outer <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition
              can be pushed down to it directly. This includes
              <code class="literal">WHERE</code> conditions having multiple
              predicates joined with <code class="literal">AND</code>,
              <code class="literal">OR</code>, or both.
            </p><p>
              For example, the query <code class="literal">SELECT * FROM (SELECT f1,
              f2 FROM t1) AS dt WHERE f1 &lt; 3 AND f2 &gt; 11</code>
              is rewritten as <code class="literal">SELECT f1, f2 FROM (SELECT f1, f2
              FROM t1 WHERE f1 &lt; 3 AND f2 &gt; 11) AS dt</code>.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              When the derived table has a <code class="literal">GROUP BY</code>
              and uses no window functions, an outer
              <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition referencing one or more
              columns which are not part of the <code class="literal">GROUP
              BY</code> can be pushed down to the derived table as a
              <code class="literal">HAVING</code> condition.
            </p><p>
              For example, <code class="literal">SELECT * FROM (SELECT i, j, SUM(k)
              AS sum FROM t1 GROUP BY i, j) AS dt WHERE sum &gt;
              100</code> is rewritten following derived condition
              pushdown as <code class="literal">SELECT * FROM (SELECT i, j, SUM(k) AS
              sum FROM t1 GROUP BY i, j HAVING sum &gt; 100) AS
              dt</code>.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              When the derived table uses a <code class="literal">GROUP BY</code>
              and the columns in the outer <code class="literal">WHERE</code>
              condition are <code class="literal">GROUP BY</code> columns, the
              <code class="literal">WHERE</code> conditions referencing those
              columns can be pushed down directly to the derived table.
            </p><p>
              For example, the query <code class="literal">SELECT * FROM (SELECT i,j,
              SUM(k) AS sum FROM t1 GROUP BY i,j) AS dt WHERE i &gt;
              10</code> is rewritten as <code class="literal">SELECT * FROM
              (SELECT i,j, SUM(k) AS sum FROM t1 WHERE i &gt; 10 GROUP
              BY i,j) AS dt</code>.
            </p><p>
              In the event that the outer <code class="literal">WHERE</code>
              condition has predicates referencing columns which are
              part of the <code class="literal">GROUP BY</code> as well as
              predicates referencing columns which are not, predicates
              of the former sort are pushed down as
              <code class="literal">WHERE</code> conditions, while those of the
              latter type are pushed down as <code class="literal">HAVING</code>
              conditions. For example, in the query <code class="literal">SELECT *
              FROM (SELECT i, j, SUM(k) AS sum FROM t1 GROUP BY i,j) AS
              dt WHERE i &gt; 10 AND sum &gt; 100</code>, the
              predicate <code class="literal">i &gt; 10</code> in the outer
              <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause references a
              <code class="literal">GROUP BY</code> column, whereas the predicate
              <code class="literal">sum &gt; 100</code> does not reference any
              <code class="literal">GROUP BY</code> column. Thus the derived table
              pushdown optimization causes the query to be rewritten in
              a manner similar to what is shown here:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT i, j, SUM(k) AS sum FROM t1
        WHERE i &gt; 10
        GROUP BY i, j
        HAVING sum &gt; 100
    ) AS dt;
</pre></li></ul></div><p>
          To enable derived condition pushdown, the
          <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_optimizer_switch"><code class="literal">optimizer_switch</code></a> system
          variable&#39;s
          <a class="link" href="switchable-optimizations.html#optflag_derived-condition-pushdown"><code class="literal">derived_condition_pushdown</code></a>
          flag (added in this release) must be set to
          <code class="literal">on</code>, which is the default setting. If this
          optimization is disabled by
          <code class="literal">optimizer_switch</code>, you can enable it for a
          specific query using the
          <a class="link" href="optimizer-hints.html#optimizer-hints-table-level" title="Table-Level Optimizer Hints"><code class="literal">DERIVED_CONDITION_PUSHDOWN</code></a>
          optimizer hint. To disable the optimization for a given query,
          use the
          <a class="link" href="optimizer-hints.html#optimizer-hints-table-level" title="Table-Level Optimizer Hints"><code class="literal">NO_DERIVED_CONDITION_PUSHDOWN</code></a>
          optimizer hint.
        </p><p>
          The following restrictions and limitations apply to the
          derived table condition pushdown optimization:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              The optimization cannot be used if the derived table
              contains <a class="link" href="union.html" title="13.2.18&nbsp;UNION Clause"><code class="literal">UNION</code></a>. This
              restriction is lifted in MySQL 8.0.29. Consider two tables
              <code class="literal">t1</code> and <code class="literal">t2</code>, and a
              view <code class="literal">v</code> containing their union, created

  KEY i1 (c1)
);

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v AS
     SELECT id, c1 FROM t1
     UNION ALL
     SELECT id, c1 FROM t2;
</pre><p>
              As be seen in the output of
              <a class="link" href="explain.html#explain-execution-plan" title="Obtaining Execution Plan Information"><code class="literal">EXPLAIN</code></a>,
              a condition present in the top level of a query such as
              <code class="literal">SELECT * FROM v WHERE c1 = 12</code> can now
              be pushed down to both query blocks in the derived table:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE SELECT * FROM v WHERE c1 = 12\G</code></strong>

              In MySQL 8.0.29 and later, the derived table condition
              pushdown optimization can be employed with
              <code class="literal">UNION</code> queries, with the following
