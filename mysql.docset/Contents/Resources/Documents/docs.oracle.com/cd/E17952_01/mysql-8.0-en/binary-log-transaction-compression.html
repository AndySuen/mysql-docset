        Beginning with MySQL 8.0.20, you can enable binary log
        transaction compression on a MySQL server instance. When binary
        log transaction compression is enabled, transaction payloads are
        compressed using the zstd algorithm, and then written to the
        server&#39;s binary log file as a single event (a
        <code class="literal">Transaction_payload_event</code>).
      </p><p>
        Compressed transaction payloads remain in a compressed state
        while they are sent in the replication stream to replicas, other
        Group Replication group members, or clients such as
        <a class="link" href="mysqlbinlog.html" title="4.6.9&nbsp;mysqlbinlog &mdash; Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"><span class="command"><strong>mysqlbinlog</strong></span></a>. They are not decompressed by
        receiver threads, and are written to the relay log still in
        their compressed state. Binary log transaction compression
        therefore saves storage space both on the originator of the
        transaction and on the recipient (and for their backups), and
        saves network bandwidth when the transactions are sent between
        server instances.
      </p><p>
        Compressed transaction payloads are decompressed when the
        individual events contained in them need to be inspected. For
        example, the <code class="literal">Transaction_payload_event</code> is
        decompressed by an applier thread in order to apply the events
        it contains on the recipient. Decompression is also carried out
        during recovery, by <a class="link" href="mysqlbinlog.html" title="4.6.9&nbsp;mysqlbinlog &mdash; Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"><span class="command"><strong>mysqlbinlog</strong></span></a> when
        replaying transactions, and by the <a class="link" href="show-binlog-events.html" title="13.7.7.2&nbsp;SHOW BINLOG EVENTS Statement"><code class="literal">SHOW
        BINLOG EVENTS</code></a> and <a class="link" href="show-relaylog-events.html" title="13.7.7.32&nbsp;SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS Statement"><code class="literal">SHOW RELAYLOG
        EVENTS</code></a> statements.
      </p><p>
        You can enable binary log transaction compression on a MySQL
        server instance using the
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression"><code class="literal">binlog_transaction_compression</code></a>
        system variable, which defaults to <code class="literal">OFF</code>. You
        can also use the
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression_level_zstd"><code class="literal">binlog_transaction_compression_level_zstd</code></a>
        system variable to set the level for the zstd algorithm that is
        used for compression. This value determines the compression
        effort, from 1 (the lowest effort) to 22 (the highest effort).
        As the compression level increases, the compression ratio
        increases, which reduces the storage space and network bandwidth
        required for the transaction payload. However, the effort
        required for data compression also increases, taking time and
        CPU and memory resources on the originating server. Increases in
        the compression effort do not have a linear relationship to
        increases in the compression ratio.

          Transactions with payloads that are compressed can be rolled
          back like any other transaction, and they can also be filtered
          out on a replica by the usual filtering options. Binary log
          transaction compression can be applied to XA transactions.
        </p><p>
          When binary log transaction compression is enabled, the
          <a class="link" href="server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_allowed_packet"><code class="literal">max_allowed_packet</code></a> and

          <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_slave_max_allowed_packet"><code class="literal">slave_max_allowed_packet</code></a>
          limits for the server still apply, and are measured on the
          compressed size of the
          <code class="literal">Transaction_payload_event</code>, plus the bytes
          used for the event header.
        </p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><div class="admon-title">Important</div><p>
            Compressed transaction payloads are sent as a single packet,
            rather than each event of the transaction being sent in an
            individual packet, as is the case when binary log
            transaction compression is not in use. If your replication
            topology handles large transactions, be aware that a large
            transaction which can be replicated successfully when binary
            log transaction compression is not in use, might stop
            replication due to its size when binary log transaction
            compression is in use.
          </p></div><p>
          For multithreaded workers, each transaction (including its
          GTID event and <code class="literal">Transaction_payload_event</code>)
          is assigned to a worker thread. The worker thread decompresses
          the transaction payload and applies the individual events in
          it one by one. If an error is found applying any event within
          the <code class="literal">Transaction_payload_event</code>, the complete
          transaction is reported to the co-ordinator as having failed.
          When <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_replica_parallel_type"><code class="literal">replica_parallel_type</code></a> or
          <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_slave_parallel_type"><code class="literal">slave_parallel_type</code></a> is set to
          <code class="literal">DATABASE</code>, all the databases affected by the
          transaction are mapped before the transaction is scheduled.
          The use of binary log transaction compression with the
          <code class="literal">DATABASE</code> policy can reduce parallelism
          compared to uncompressed transactions, which are mapped and
          scheduled for each event.
        </p><p>
          For semisynchronous replication (see
          <a class="xref" href="replication-semisync.html" title="17.4.10&nbsp;Semisynchronous Replication">Section&nbsp;17.4.10, &ldquo;Semisynchronous Replication&rdquo;</a>), the replica
          acknowledges the transaction when the complete
          <code class="literal">Transaction_payload_event</code> has been
          received.
        </p><p>
          When binary log checksums are enabled (which is the default),
          the replication source server does not write checksums for
          individual events in a compressed transaction payload.
          Instead, a checksum is written for the complete
          <code class="literal">Transaction_payload_event</code>, and individual
          checksums are written for any events that were not compressed,
          such as events relating to GTIDs.

          When a source in a replication topology and its replica both
          have binary log transaction compression enabled, the replica
          receives compressed transaction payloads and writes them
          compressed to its relay log. It decompresses the transaction
          payloads to apply the transactions, and then compresses them
          again after applying for writing to its binary log. Any
          downstream replicas receive the compressed transaction
          payloads.
        </p><p>
          When a source in a replication topology has binary log
          transaction compression enabled but its replica does not, the
          replica receives compressed transaction payloads and writes
          them compressed to its relay log. It decompresses the
          transaction payloads to apply the transactions, and then
          writes them uncompressed to its own binary log, if it has one.
          Any downstream replicas receive the uncompressed transaction
          payloads.
        </p><p>
          When a source in a replication topology does not have binary
          log transaction compression enabled but its replica does, if
          the replica has a binary log, it compresses the transaction
          payloads after applying them, and writes the compressed
          transaction payloads to its binary log. Any downstream
          replicas receive the compressed transaction payloads.
        </p><p>
          When a MySQL server instance has no binary log, if it is at a
          release from MySQL 8.0.20, it can receive, handle, and display
          compressed transaction payloads regardless of its value for
          <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression"><code class="literal">binlog_transaction_compression</code></a>.
          Compressed transaction payloads received by such server
          instances are written in their compressed state to the relay
          log, so they benefit indirectly from compression that was
          carried out by other servers in the replication topology.
        </p><p>
          A replica at a release before MySQL 8.0.20 cannot replicate
          from a source with binary log transaction compression enabled.
          A replica at or above MySQL 8.0.20 can replicate from a source
          at an earlier release that does not support binary log
          transaction compression, and can carry out its own compression
          on transactions received from that source when writing them to
          its own binary log.

          You can enable connection compression at the protocol level
          for replication connections, using the
          <code class="literal">SOURCE_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS</code> |
          <code class="literal">MASTER_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS</code> and
          <code class="literal">SOURCE_ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL</code> |
          <code class="literal">MASTER_ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL</code>options of the
          <a class="link" href="change-replication-source-to.html" title="13.4.2.3&nbsp;CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement"><code class="literal">CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO</code></a>
          statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or <a class="link" href="change-master-to.html" title="13.4.2.1&nbsp;CHANGE MASTER TO Statement"><code class="literal">CHANGE
          MASTER TO</code></a> statement (before MySQL 8.0.23), or the
          <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_replica_compressed_protocol"><code class="literal">replica_compressed_protocol</code></a>
          or <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_slave_compressed_protocol"><code class="literal">slave_compressed_protocol</code></a>
          system variable. If you enable binary log transaction
          compression in a system where connection compression is also
          enabled, the impact of connection compression is reduced, as
          there might be little opportunity to further compress the
          compressed transaction payloads. However, connection
          compression can still operate on uncompressed events and on
          message headers. Binary log transaction compression can be
          enabled in combination with connection compression if you need
          to save storage space as well as network bandwidth. For more
          information on connection compression for replication
          connections, see
          <a class="xref" href="connection-compression-control.html" title="4.2.8&nbsp;Connection Compression Control">Section&nbsp;4.2.8, &ldquo;Connection Compression Control&rdquo;</a>.
        </p><p>
          For Group Replication, compression is enabled by default for
          messages that exceed the threshold set by the
          <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_compression_threshold"><code class="literal">group_replication_compression_threshold</code></a>
          system variable. You can also configure compression for
          messages sent for distributed recovery by the method of state
          transfer from a donor&#39;s binary log, using the
          <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_compression_algorithms"><code class="literal">group_replication_recovery_compression_algorithms</code></a>
          and
          <a class="link" href="group-replication-options.html#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_zstd_compression_level"><code class="literal">group_replication_recovery_zstd_compression_level</code></a>
          system variables. If you enable binary log transaction
          compression in a system where these are configured, Group
          Replication&#39;s message compression can still operate on
          uncompressed events and on message headers, but its impact is
          reduced. For more information on message compression for Group
          Replication, see
          <a class="xref" href="group-replication-message-compression.html" title="18.7.4&nbsp;Message Compression">Section&nbsp;18.7.4, &ldquo;Message Compression&rdquo;</a>.
