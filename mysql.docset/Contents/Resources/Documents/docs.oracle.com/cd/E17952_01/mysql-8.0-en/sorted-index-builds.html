      <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> performs a bulk load instead of
      inserting one index record at a time when creating or rebuilding
      indexes. This method of index creation is also known as a sorted
      index build. Sorted index builds are not supported for spatial
      indexes.
    </p><p>
      There are three phases to an index build. In the first phase, the
      <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_clustered_index" title="clustered index">clustered index</a> is
      scanned, and index entries are generated and added to the sort
      buffer. When the <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_sort_buffer" title="sort buffer">sort
      buffer</a> becomes full, entries are sorted and written out to
      a temporary intermediate file. This process is also known as a
      <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">run</span>&rdquo;</span>. In the second phase, with one or more runs
      written to the temporary intermediate file, a merge sort is
      performed on all entries in the file. In the third and final
      phase, the sorted entries are inserted into the
      <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_b_tree" title="B-tree">B-tree</a>.

    </p><p>
      Prior to the introduction of sorted index builds, index entries
      were inserted into the B-tree one record at a time using insert
      APIs. This method involved opening a B-tree
      <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_cursor" title="cursor">cursor</a> to find the insert
      position and then inserting entries into a B-tree page using an
      <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_optimistic" title="optimistic">optimistic</a> insert. If an
      insert failed due to a page being full, a
      <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_pessimistic" title="pessimistic">pessimistic</a> insert would
      be performed, which involves opening a B-tree cursor and splitting
      and merging B-tree nodes as necessary to find space for the entry.
      The drawbacks of this <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">top-down</span>&rdquo;</span> method of building
      an index are the cost of searching for an insert position and the
      constant splitting and merging of B-tree nodes.
    </p><p>
      Sorted index builds use a <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">bottom-up</span>&rdquo;</span> approach to
      building an index. With this approach, a reference to the
      right-most leaf page is held at all levels of the B-tree. The
      right-most leaf page at the necessary B-tree depth is allocated
      and entries are inserted according to their sorted order. Once a
      leaf page is full, a node pointer is appended to the parent page
      and a sibling leaf page is allocated for the next insert. This
      process continues until all entries are inserted, which may result
      in inserts up to the root level. When a sibling page is allocated,
      the reference to the previously pinned leaf page is released, and
      the newly allocated leaf page becomes the right-most leaf page and
      new default insert location.
    </p><h5><a id="idm45828891153376"></a>Reserving B-tree Page Space for Future Index Growth</h5><p>
      To set aside space for future index growth, you can use the
      <a class="link" href="innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_fill_factor"><code class="literal">innodb_fill_factor</code></a> variable to
      reserve a percentage of B-tree page space. For example, setting
      <a class="link" href="innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_fill_factor"><code class="literal">innodb_fill_factor</code></a> to 80 reserves
      20 percent of the space in B-tree pages during a sorted index
      build. This setting applies to both B-tree leaf and non-leaf
      pages. It does not apply to external pages used for
      <a class="link" href="blob.html" title="11.3.4&nbsp;The BLOB and TEXT Types"><code class="literal">TEXT</code></a> or
      <a class="link" href="blob.html" title="11.3.4&nbsp;The BLOB and TEXT Types"><code class="literal">BLOB</code></a> entries. The amount of space
      that is reserved may not be exactly as configured, as the
      <a class="link" href="innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_fill_factor"><code class="literal">innodb_fill_factor</code></a> value is
      interpreted as a hint rather than a hard limit.
    </p><h5><a id="idm45828891145440"></a>Sorted Index Builds and Full-Text Index Support</h5><p>
      Sorted index builds are supported for
      <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_fulltext_index" title="FULLTEXT index">fulltext indexes</a>.
      Previously, SQL was used to insert entries into a fulltext index.
    </p><h5><a id="idm45828891143216"></a>Sorted Index Builds and Compressed Tables</h5><p>
      For <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_compression" title="compression">compressed tables</a>, the
      previous index creation method appended entries to both compressed
      and uncompressed pages. When the modification log (representing
      free space on the compressed page) became full, the compressed
      page would be recompressed. If compression failed due to a lack of
      space, the page would be split. With sorted index builds, entries
      are only appended to uncompressed pages. When an uncompressed page
      becomes full, it is compressed. Adaptive padding is used to ensure
      that compression succeeds in most cases, but if compression fails,
      the page is split and compression is attempted again. This process
      continues until compression is successful. For more information
      about compression of B-Tree pages, see
      <a class="xref" href="innodb-compression-internals.html" title="15.9.1.5&nbsp;How Compression Works for InnoDB Tables">Section&nbsp;15.9.1.5, &ldquo;How Compression Works for InnoDB Tables&rdquo;</a>.
    </p><h5><a id="idm45828891139696"></a>Sorted Index Builds and Redo Logging</h5><p>
      <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_redo_log" title="redo log">Redo logging</a> is disabled
      during a sorted index build. Instead, there is a
      <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_checkpoint" title="checkpoint">checkpoint</a> to ensure that
      the index build can withstand an unexpected exit or failure. The
      checkpoint forces a write of all dirty pages to disk. During a
      sorted index build, the <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_page_cleaner" title="page cleaner">page
      cleaner</a> thread is signaled periodically to flush
      <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_dirty_page" title="dirty page">dirty pages</a> to ensure that
      the checkpoint operation can be processed quickly. Normally, the
      page cleaner thread flushes dirty pages when the number of clean
      pages falls below a set threshold. For sorted index builds, dirty
      pages are flushed promptly to reduce checkpoint overhead and to
      parallelize I/O and CPU activity.
    </p><h5><a id="idm45828891134592"></a>Sorted Index Builds and Optimizer Statistics</h5><p>
      Sorted index builds may result in
      <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glos_optimizer" title="optimizer">optimizer</a> statistics that
      differ from those generated by the previous method of index
      creation. The difference in statistics, which is not expected to
      affect workload performance, is due to the different algorithm
      used to populate the index.
